1
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:14,258
- Okay we have a lot to cover
today so let's get started.

2
00:00:14,258 --> 00:00:17,454
Today we'll be talking
about Generative Models.

3
00:00:17,454 --> 00:00:20,484
And before we start, a few
administrative details.

4
00:00:20,484 --> 00:00:23,522
So midterm grades will be
released on Gradescope this week

5
00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:27,730
A reminder that A3 is
due next Friday May 26th.

6
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,376
The HyperQuest deadline for
extra credit you can do this

7
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:32,709
still until Sunday May 21st.

8
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:37,799
And our poster session is
June 6th from 12 to 3 P.M..

9
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:43,095
Okay so an overview of what
we're going to talk about today

10
00:00:43,095 --> 00:00:44,646
we're going to switch gears a little bit

11
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:47,759
and take a look at
unsupervised learning today.

12
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,686
And in particular we're going
to talk about generative

13
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:54,103
models which is a type
of unsupervised learning.

14
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:57,112
And we'll look at three
types of generative models.

15
00:00:57,112 --> 00:01:01,174
So pixelRNNs and pixelCNNs
variational autoencoders

16
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:04,174
and Generative Adversarial networks.

17
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:07,847
So so far in this class we've
talked a lot about supervised

18
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:09,672
learning and different kinds

19
00:01:09,672 --> 00:01:11,168
of supervised learning problems.

20
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,247
So in the supervised learning
set up we have our data X and

21
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:16,078
then we have some labels Y.

22
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:19,063
And our goal is to learn
a function that's mapping

23
00:01:19,063 --> 00:01:21,417
from our data X to our labels Y.

24
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:26,237
And these labels can take
many different types of forms.

25
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:28,390
So for example, we've
looked at classification

26
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,303
where our input is an image

27
00:01:30,303 --> 00:01:34,934
and we want to output Y, a
class label for the category.

28
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:37,214
We've talked about object
detection where now our input

29
00:01:37,214 --> 00:01:39,926
is still an image but
here we want to output the

30
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:44,093
bounding boxes of instances of
up to multiple dogs or cats.

31
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:48,532
We've talked about semantic
segmentation where here we have

32
00:01:48,532 --> 00:01:51,069
a label for every pixel the
category that every pixel

33
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:51,986
belongs to.

34
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,298
And we've also talked
about image captioning

35
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:58,961
where here our label is now a sentence

36
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:02,961
and so it's now in the
form of natural language.

37
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,534
So unsupervised learning in this set up,

38
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:08,095
it's a type of learning where here we have

39
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:11,520
unlabeled training data and
our goal now is to learn some

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,661
underlying hidden structure of the data.

41
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:17,439
Right, so an example of
this can be something like

42
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,370
clustering which you guys
might have seen before

43
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,534
where here the goal is to
find groups within the data

44
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:25,029
that are similar through
some type of metric.

45
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:27,187
For example, K means clustering.

46
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:30,371
Another example of an
unsupervised learning task

47
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:32,871
is a dimensionality reduction.

48
00:02:33,777 --> 00:02:36,634
So in this problem want
to find axes along which

49
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:38,939
our training data has the most variation,

50
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:42,298
and so these axes are part
of the underlying structure

51
00:02:42,298 --> 00:02:43,537
of the data.

52
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:45,685
And then we can use this
to reduce of dimensionality

53
00:02:45,685 --> 00:02:48,918
of the data such that the
data has significant variation

54
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,095
among each of the remaining dimensions.

55
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:52,938
Right, so this example
here we start off with data

56
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:56,014
in three dimensions and
we're going to find two

57
00:02:56,014 --> 00:02:57,842
axes of variation in this case

58
00:02:57,842 --> 00:03:01,259
and reduce our data projected down to 2D.

59
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:06,214
Another example of unsupervised learning

60
00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:09,964
is learning feature
representations for data.

61
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:14,137
We've seen how to do this
in supervised ways before

62
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:15,645
where we used the supervised loss,

63
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:17,209
for example classification.

64
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,743
Where we have the classification label.

65
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:21,617
We have something like a Softmax loss

66
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:23,671
And we can train a neural network where

67
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,635
we can interpret activations for example

68
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:27,723
our FC7 layers as some kind of future

69
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:29,869
representation for the data.

70
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:31,791
And in an unsupervised setting,

71
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,492
for example here
autoencoders which we'll talk

72
00:03:34,492 --> 00:03:35,742
more about later

73
00:03:35,742 --> 00:03:38,349
In this case our loss is now trying to

74
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:41,962
reconstruct the input data to basically,

75
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:44,685
you have a good reconstruction
of our input data

76
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:46,872
and use this to learn features.

77
00:03:46,872 --> 00:03:49,162
So we're learning a feature
representation without

78
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,245
using any additional external labels.

79
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:56,411
And finally another example
of unsupervised learning

80
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:59,585
is density estimation where
in this case we want to

81
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:02,884
estimate the underlying
distribution of our data.

82
00:04:02,884 --> 00:04:05,581
So for example in this top case over here,

83
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:08,432
we have points in 1-d and we can try

84
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:10,811
and fit a Gaussian into this density

85
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:13,757
and in this bottom example
over here it's 2D data

86
00:04:13,757 --> 00:04:16,605
and here again we're trying
to estimate the density and

87
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:18,750
we can model this density.

88
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,988
We want to fit a model such
that the density is higher

89
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:24,239
where there's more points concentrated.

90
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,377
And so to summarize the
differences in unsupervised

91
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:32,069
learning which we've looked a lot so far,

92
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:33,657
we want to use label data to learn

93
00:04:33,657 --> 00:04:35,990
a function mapping from X to Y

94
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,515
and an unsupervised
learning we use no labels

95
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:40,716
and instead we try to learn
some underlying hidden

96
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:44,124
structure of the data,
whether this is grouping,

97
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:48,291
acts as a variation or
underlying density estimation.

98
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:51,855
And unsupervised learning is a huge

99
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:54,113
and really exciting area of research and

100
00:04:54,113 --> 00:04:57,074
and some of the reasons are
that training data is really

101
00:04:57,074 --> 00:04:59,898
cheap, it doesn't use labels
so we're able to learn

102
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:04,339
from a lot of data at one time
and basically utilize a lot

103
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:07,672
more data than if we required annotating

104
00:05:07,672 --> 00:05:09,977
or finding labels for data.

105
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,345
And unsupervised learning
is still relatively

106
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:15,758
unsolved research area by comparison.

107
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:17,823
There's a lot of open problems in this,

108
00:05:17,823 --> 00:05:20,483
but it also, it holds the potential of

109
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:22,029
if you're able to successfully learn

110
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:24,669
and represent a lot of
the underlying structure

111
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,434
in the data then this also takes you a

112
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:30,229
long way towards the Holy Grail
of trying to understand the

113
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,729
structure of the visual world.

114
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:38,222
So that's a little bit of kind
of a high-level big picture

115
00:05:38,222 --> 00:05:40,432
view of unsupervised learning.

116
00:05:40,432 --> 00:05:44,155
And today will focus more
specifically on generative models

117
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:46,996
which is a class of
models for unsupervised

118
00:05:46,996 --> 00:05:50,369
learning where given training
data our goal is to try and

119
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:52,933
generate new samples from
the same distribution.

120
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:55,441
Right, so we have training
data over here generated

121
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:57,686
from some distribution P data

122
00:05:57,686 --> 00:06:00,769
and we want to learn a model, P model

123
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:04,955
to generate samples from
the same distribution

124
00:06:04,955 --> 00:06:09,854
and so we want to learn P
model to be similar to P data.

125
00:06:09,854 --> 00:06:12,636
And generative models
address density estimations.

126
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:14,551
So this problem that we
saw earlier of trying

127
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:18,217
to estimate the underlying
distribution of your

128
00:06:18,217 --> 00:06:20,093
training data which is a core problem

129
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:22,180
in unsupervised learning.

130
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,190
And we'll see that there's
several flavors of this.

131
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,461
We can use generative models
to do explicit density

132
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:31,270
estimation where we're
going to explicitly define

133
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,353
and solve for our P model

134
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:37,610
or we can also do implicit
density estimation

135
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,868
where in this case we'll
learn a model that can

136
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:45,035
produce samples from P model
without explicitly defining it.

137
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,016
So, why do we care
about generative models?

138
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:52,584
Why is this a really
interesting core problem

139
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:54,096
in unsupervised learning?

140
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:55,868
Well there's a lot of
things that we can do

141
00:06:55,868 --> 00:06:57,451
with generative models.

142
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:01,243
If we're able to create
realistic samples from the data

143
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:03,826
distributions that we want
we can do really cool things

144
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:04,659
with this, right?

145
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:07,143
We can generate just
beautiful samples to start

146
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:11,334
with so on the left you can
see a completely new samples of

147
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:14,568
just generated by these generative models.

148
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,387
Also in the center here
generated samples of

149
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:21,042
images we can also do tasks
like super resolution,

150
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:25,232
colorization so hallucinating
or filling in these edges

151
00:07:25,232 --> 00:07:27,732
with generated ideas of colors

152
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:32,145
and what the purse should look like.

153
00:07:32,145 --> 00:07:36,022
We can also use generative
models of time series data

154
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:39,147
for simulation and planning
and so this will be useful in

155
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:41,619
for reinforcement learning applications

156
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:43,558
which we'll talk a bit more
about reinforcement learning

157
00:07:43,558 --> 00:07:45,089
in a later lecture.

158
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,190
And training generative
models can also enable

159
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,261
inference of latent representations.

160
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:54,018
Learning latent features
that can be useful

161
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:57,435
as general features for downstream tasks.

162
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:02,188
So if we look at types
of generative models

163
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:05,688
these can be organized
into the taxonomy here

164
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:08,789
where we have these two major
branches that we talked about,

165
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:13,180
explicit density models and
implicit density models.

166
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,202
And then we can also get down into many

167
00:08:16,202 --> 00:08:19,062
of these other sub categories.

168
00:08:19,062 --> 00:08:23,423
And well we can refer to
this figure is adapted

169
00:08:23,423 --> 00:08:27,814
from a tutorial on GANs
from Ian Goodfellow

170
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:29,713
and so if you're interested in some

171
00:08:29,713 --> 00:08:32,501
of these different taxonomy
and categorizations of

172
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:35,749
generative models this is a
good resource that you can take

173
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:36,861
a look at.

174
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:39,052
But today we're going to
discuss three of the most

175
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:43,259
popular types of generative
models that are in use

176
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:45,645
and in research today.

177
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:49,475
And so we'll talk first briefly
about pixelRNNs and CNNs

178
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:52,162
And then we'll talk about
variational autoencoders.

179
00:08:52,162 --> 00:08:55,661
These are both types of
explicit density models.

180
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,494
One that's using a tractable density

181
00:08:57,494 --> 00:09:01,312
and another that's using
an approximate density

182
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:05,614
And then we'll talk about
generative adversarial networks,

183
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:09,781
GANs which are a type of
implicit density estimation.

184
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:16,304
So let's first talk
about pixelRNNs and CNNs.

185
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:20,015
So these are a type of fully
visible belief networks

186
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:22,432
which are modeling a density explicitly

187
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:25,966
so in this case what
they do is we have this

188
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,958
image data X that we have
and we want to model the

189
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,236
probability or likelihood
of this image P of X.

190
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:34,941
Right and so in this case,
for these kinds of models,

191
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,646
we use the chain rule to
decompose this likelihood

192
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:40,384
into a product of one
dimensional distribution.

193
00:09:40,384 --> 00:09:43,493
So we have here the
probability of each pixel X I

194
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:47,871
conditioned on all previous
pixels X1 through XI - 1.

195
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:50,495
and your likelihood all
right, your joint likelihood

196
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:53,416
of all the pixels in your image
is going to be the product

197
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,474
of all of these pixels together,

198
00:09:55,474 --> 00:09:58,073
all of these likelihoods together.

199
00:09:58,073 --> 00:10:00,690
And then once we define this likelihood,

200
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,428
in order to train this
model we can just maximize

201
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:06,688
the likelihood of our training data

202
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:08,938
under this defined density.

203
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,334
So if we look at this this
distribution over pixel values

204
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:17,319
right, we have this P of
XI given all the previous

205
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:20,833
pixel values, well this is a
really complex distribution.

206
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,700
So how can we model this?

207
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,478
Well we've seen before that
if we want to have complex

208
00:10:25,478 --> 00:10:29,042
transformations we can do
these using neural networks.

209
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,766
Neural networks are a good
way to express complex

210
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:32,828
transformations.

211
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:36,189
And so what we'll do is
we'll use a neural network

212
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:40,633
to express this complex
function that we have

213
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:42,300
of the distribution.

214
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:44,796
And one thing you'll see here is that,

215
00:10:44,796 --> 00:10:47,379
okay even if we're going to
use a neural network for this

216
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:50,379
another thing we have to take
care of is how do we order

217
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:51,212
the pixels.

218
00:10:51,212 --> 00:10:54,009
Right, I said here that
we have a distribution

219
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:56,577
for P of XI given all previous pixels

220
00:10:56,577 --> 00:10:58,886
but what does all
previous the pixels mean?

221
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:01,303
So we'll take a look at that.

222
00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:06,669
So PixelRNN was a model proposed in 2016

223
00:11:07,595 --> 00:11:11,762
that basically defines a way
for setting up and optimizing

224
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:17,657
this problem and so
how this model works is

225
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:19,479
that we're going to
generate pixels starting

226
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,187
in a corner of the image.

227
00:11:21,187 --> 00:11:25,767
So we can look at this grid
as basically the pixels

228
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:28,039
of your image and so what
we're going to do is start

229
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:31,050
from the pixel in the
upper left-hand corner

230
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,548
and then we're going to
sequentially generate pixels based

231
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:36,131
on these connections from the arrows

232
00:11:36,131 --> 00:11:37,195
that you can see here.

233
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:39,962
And each of the dependencies
on the previous pixels

234
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:44,332
in this ordering is going
to be modeled using an RNN

235
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:47,114
or more specifically an
LSTM which we've seen before

236
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:48,092
in lecture.

237
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:51,385
Right so using this we can
basically continue to move

238
00:11:51,385 --> 00:11:55,242
forward just moving
down a long is diagonal

239
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:57,860
and generating all of these
pixel values dependent

240
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,244
on the pixels that they're connected to.

241
00:12:01,244 --> 00:12:03,925
And so this works really
well but the drawback here

242
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:05,908
is that this sequential generation, right,

243
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:08,736
so it's actually quite slow to do this.

244
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:10,869
You can imagine you know if
you're going to generate a new

245
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:13,334
image instead of all of these
feed forward networks that we

246
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:15,061
see, we've seen with CNNs.

247
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:16,952
Here we're going to have
to iteratively go through

248
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:20,952
and generate all these
images, all these pixels.

249
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:27,499
So a little bit later, after a pixelRNN,

250
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:30,575
another model called
pixelCNN was introduced.

251
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:34,570
And this has very
similar setup as pixelCNN

252
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,887
and we're still going to
do this image generation

253
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:39,801
starting from the corner of
the of the image and expanding

254
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:43,074
outwards but the difference now
is that now instead of using

255
00:12:43,074 --> 00:12:45,480
an RNN to model all these dependencies

255
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,752
we're going to use the CNN instead.

256
00:12:47,752 --> 00:12:52,179
And we're now going to use a
CNN over a a context region

257
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:54,761
that you can see here around
in the particular pixel

258
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:56,384
that we're going to generate now.

259
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:58,127
Right so we take the pixels around it,

260
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:02,843
this gray area within the
region that's already been

261
00:13:02,843 --> 00:13:05,480
generated and then we can
pass this through a CNN

262
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,313
and use that to generate
our next pixel value.

263
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,466
And so what this is going to
give is this is going to give

264
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:18,055
This is a CNN, a neural
network at each pixel location

265
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:20,176
right and so the output of
this is going to be a soft

266
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:22,967
max loss over the pixel values here.

267
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:27,443
In this case we have a 0 to
255 and then we can train this

268
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:31,193
by maximizing the likelihood
of the training images.

269
00:13:31,193 --> 00:13:35,810
Right so we say that basically
we want to take a training

270
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,659
image we're going to do
this generation process

271
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:43,482
and at each pixel location
we have the ground truth

272
00:13:43,482 --> 00:13:45,742
training data image
value that we have here

273
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,541
and this is a quick basically the label

274
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,384
or the the the classification
label that we want

275
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:53,976
our pixel to be which of these 255 values

276
00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:56,723
and we can train this
using a Softmax loss.

277
00:13:56,723 --> 00:13:59,155
Right and so basically
the effect of doing this

278
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:01,285
is that we're going to
maximize the likelihood

279
00:14:01,285 --> 00:14:05,597
of our training data
pixels being generated.

280
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:06,981
Okay any questions about this?

281
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:08,413
Yes.

282
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:12,159
[student's words obscured
due to lack of microphone]

283
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:14,117
Yeah, so the question is,
I thought we were talking

284
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:16,606
about unsupervised learning,
why do we have basically

285
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,675
a classification label here?

286
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:22,833
The reason is that this loss,
this output that we have

287
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,970
is the value of the input training data.

288
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,983
So we have no external labels, right?

289
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:31,645
We didn't go and have to
manually collect any labels

290
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:34,366
for this, we're just taking our input data

291
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:38,533
and saying that this is what
we used for the last function.

292
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,366
[student's words obscured
due to lack of microphone]

293
00:14:47,998 --> 00:14:50,746
The question is, is
this like bag of words?

294
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:53,109
I would say it's not really bag of words,

295
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,784
it's more saying that we
want where we're outputting

296
00:14:55,784 --> 00:14:58,724
a distribution over pixel
values at each location

297
00:14:58,724 --> 00:15:01,466
of our image right, and what we want to do

298
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:06,444
is we want to maximize the
likelihood of our input,

299
00:15:06,444 --> 00:15:10,442
our training data being
produced, being generated.

300
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,761
Right so, in that sense, this
is why it's using our input

301
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:15,761
data to create our loss.

302
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:24,904
So using pixelCNN training
is faster than pixelRNN

303
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:28,275
because here now right
at every pixel location

304
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:31,249
we want to maximize the value of our,

305
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:34,301
we want to maximize the
likelihood of our training data

306
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:38,035
showing up and so we have all
of these values already right,

307
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:40,739
just from our training data
and so we can do this much

308
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,340
faster but a generation time
for a test time we want to

309
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,296
generate a completely new
image right, just starting from

310
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:50,545
the corner and we're not,
we're not trying to do any type

311
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:52,572
of learning so in that
generation time we still

312
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:56,609
have to generate each
of these pixel locations

313
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:59,197
before we can generate the next location.

314
00:15:59,197 --> 00:16:01,695
And so generation time here
it still slow even though

315
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,025
training time is faster.

316
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,204
Question.

317
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:08,365
[student's words obscured
due to lack of microphone]

318
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:10,517
So the question is, is
this training a sensitive

319
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:14,077
distribution to what you
pick for the first pixel?

320
00:16:14,077 --> 00:16:17,376
Yeah, so it is dependent on
what you have as the initial

321
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,041
pixel distribution and then
everything is conditioned

322
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,208
based on that.

323
00:16:23,203 --> 00:16:26,667
So again, how do you
pick this distribution?

324
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:29,428
So at training time you
have these distributions

325
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:32,171
from your training data
and then at generation time

326
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:35,305
you can just initialize
this with either uniform

327
00:16:35,305 --> 00:16:38,368
or from your training
data, however you want.

328
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:40,612
And then once you have that
everything else is conditioned

329
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:42,553
based on that.

330
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:43,912
Question.

331
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:48,079
[student's words obscured
due to lack of microphone]

332
00:17:07,415 --> 00:17:09,761
Yeah so the question is is
there a way that we define

333
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:12,469
this in this chain rule
fashion instead of predicting

334
00:17:12,469 --> 00:17:14,146
all the pixels at one time?

335
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:17,884
And so we'll see, we'll see
models later that do do this,

336
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:20,164
but what the chain rule allows
us to do is it allows us

337
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,701
to find this very tractable
density that we can then

338
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:27,868
basically optimize and do,
directly optimizes likelihood

339
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:34,982
Okay so these are some
examples of generations

340
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:39,606
from this model and so here
on the left you can see

341
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:42,742
generations where the
training data is CIFAR-10,

342
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:43,995
CIFAR-10 dataset.

343
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:46,115
And so you can see that in
general they are starting

344
00:17:46,115 --> 00:17:48,846
to capture statistics of natural images.

345
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:51,931
You can see general types of blobs

346
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:55,879
and kind of things that look
like parts of natural images

347
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:56,848
coming out.

348
00:17:56,848 --> 00:17:59,647
On the right here it's ImageNet,
we can again see samples

349
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:00,730
from here and

350
00:18:03,022 --> 00:18:05,060
these are starting to
look like natural images

351
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,966
but they're still not, there's
still room for improvement.

352
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:12,634
You can still see that there
are differences obviously

353
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,226
with regional training images
and some of the semantics

354
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:17,059
are not clear in here.

355
00:18:19,371 --> 00:18:23,508
So, to summarize this,
pixelRNNs and CNNs allow you

356
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:27,020
to explicitly compute likelihood P of X.

357
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,297
It's an explicit density
that we can optimize.

358
00:18:29,297 --> 00:18:31,585
And being able to do this
also has another benefit

359
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:34,043
of giving a good evaluation metric.

360
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:36,934
You know you can kind of measure
how good your samples are

361
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:40,958
by this likelihood of the
data that you can compute.

362
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:44,009
And it's able to produce
pretty good samples

363
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:47,043
but it's still an active area of research

364
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,401
and the main disadvantage
of these methods is that

365
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:53,760
the generation is sequential
and so it can be pretty slow.

366
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,534
And these kinds of methods
have also been used

367
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:59,324
for generating audio for example.

368
00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:02,724
And you can look online for
some pretty interesting examples

369
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,460
of this, but again the drawback
is that it takes a long time

370
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,170
to generate these samples.

371
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,856
And so there's a lot of work,
has been work since then

372
00:19:11,856 --> 00:19:14,565
on still on improving pixelCNN performance

373
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:17,964
And so all kinds of different
you know architecture changes

374
00:19:17,964 --> 00:19:20,641
add the loss function
formulating this differently

375
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:22,346
on different types of training tricks

376
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:25,914
And so if you're interested
in learning more about this

377
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:29,495
you can look at some of
these papers on PixelCNN

378
00:19:29,495 --> 00:19:33,115
and then other pixelCNN plus
plus better improved version

379
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:35,115
that came out this year.

380
00:19:37,455 --> 00:19:39,748
Okay so now we're going
to talk about another type

381
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:44,321
of generative models call
variational autoencoders.

382
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:48,263
And so far we saw that
pixelCNNs defined a tractable

383
00:19:48,263 --> 00:19:52,204
density function, right,
using this this definition

384
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:55,365
and based on that we can
optimize directly optimize

385
00:19:55,365 --> 00:19:58,365
the likelihood of the training data.

386
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:02,409
So with variational autoencoders
now we're going to define

387
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,195
an intractable density function.

388
00:20:04,195 --> 00:20:06,833
We're now going to model this
with an additional latent

389
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,492
variable Z and we'll talk in more detail

390
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:10,769
about how this looks.

391
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:14,936
And so our data likelihood
P of X is now basically

392
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,886
has to be this integral right,

393
00:20:17,886 --> 00:20:21,422
taking the expectation over
all possible values of Z.

394
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:24,016
And so this now is going to be a problem.

395
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:26,909
We'll see that we cannot
optimize this directly.

396
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:29,349
And so instead what we have
to do is we have to derive

397
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:33,706
and optimize a lower bound
on the likelihood instead.

398
00:20:33,706 --> 00:20:34,956
Yeah, question.

399
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:37,592
So the question is is what is Z?

400
00:20:37,592 --> 00:20:41,195
Z is a latent variable
and I'll go through this

401
00:20:41,195 --> 00:20:42,862
in much more detail.

402
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:48,538
So let's talk about some background first.

403
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:52,071
Variational autoencoders
are related to a type of

404
00:20:52,071 --> 00:20:54,733
unsupervised learning
model called autoencoders.

405
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:58,267
And so we'll talk little bit
more first about autoencoders

406
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:00,965
and what they are and then
I'll explain how variational

407
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:04,332
autoencoders are related
and build off of this

408
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:05,851
and allow you to generate data.

409
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:09,168
So with autoencoders we don't
use this to generate data,

410
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:12,132
but it's an unsupervised
approach for learning a lower

411
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:13,769
dimensional feature representation

412
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:15,719
from unlabeled training data.

413
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:18,399
All right so in this case
we have our input data X

414
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:20,300
and then we're going to
want to learn some features

415
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,550
that we call Z.

416
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,708
And then we'll have an encoder
that's going to be a mapping,

417
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,188
a function mapping
from this input data

418
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:29,605
to our feature Z.

419
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:33,905
And this encoder can take
many different forms right,

420
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:37,070
they would generally use
neural networks so originally

421
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,981
these models have been
around, autoencoders have been

422
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:41,239
around for a long time.

423
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:45,803
So in the 2000s we used linear
layers of non-linearities,

424
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:49,650
then later on we had fully
connected deeper networks

425
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:53,556
and then after that we moved
on to using CNNs for these

426
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:54,389
encoders.

427
00:21:55,385 --> 00:21:59,995
So we take our input data
X and then we map this

428
00:21:59,995 --> 00:22:01,351
to some feature Z.

429
00:22:01,351 --> 00:22:05,249
And Z we usually have as,
we usually specify this

430
00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:09,138
to be smaller than X and we
perform basically dimensionality

431
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:11,817
reduction because of that.

432
00:22:11,817 --> 00:22:16,189
So the question who has an
idea of why do we want to do

433
00:22:16,189 --> 00:22:17,729
dimensionality reduction here?

434
00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:20,896
Why do we want Z to be smaller than X?

435
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:23,415
Yeah.

436
00:22:23,415 --> 00:22:25,497
[student's words obscured
due to lack of microphone]

437
00:22:25,497 --> 00:22:28,074
So the answer I heard is Z
should represent the most

438
00:22:28,074 --> 00:22:31,657
important features in
X and that's correct.

439
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:36,517
So we want Z to be able to
learn features that can capture

440
00:22:36,517 --> 00:22:38,758
meaningful factors of
variation in the data.

441
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:41,758
Right this makes them good features.

442
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:46,717
So how can we learn this
feature representation?

443
00:22:46,717 --> 00:22:50,570
Well the way autoencoders
do this is that we train

444
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:54,513
the model such that the features
can be used to reconstruct

445
00:22:54,513 --> 00:22:55,944
our original data.

446
00:22:55,944 --> 00:22:59,563
So what we want is we want to
have input data that we use

447
00:22:59,563 --> 00:23:03,730
an encoder to map it to some
lower dimensional features Z.

448
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,926
This is the output of the encoder network,

449
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:09,178
and we want to be able to
take these features that were

450
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:13,125
produced based on this input
data and then use a decoder

451
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:16,554
a second network and be
able to output now something

452
00:23:16,554 --> 00:23:21,466
of the same size dimensionality
as X and have it be similar

453
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,032
to X right so we want to be
able to reconstruct the original

454
00:23:24,032 --> 00:23:24,865
data.

455
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:31,228
And again for the decoder we
are basically using same types

456
00:23:31,228 --> 00:23:33,375
of networks as encoders so
it's usually a little bit

457
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:37,083
symmetric and now we can use CNN networks

458
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,583
for most of these.

459
00:23:41,675 --> 00:23:44,145
Okay so the process is going
to be we're going to take

460
00:23:44,145 --> 00:23:48,720
our input data right we pass
it through our encoder first

461
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,045
which is going to be something
for example like a four layer

462
00:23:51,045 --> 00:23:53,996
convolutional network and
then we're going to pass it,

463
00:23:53,996 --> 00:23:56,698
get these features and then
we're going to pass it through

464
00:23:56,698 --> 00:24:00,323
a decoder which is a four layer
for example upconvolutional

465
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:03,314
network and then get a
reconstructed data out at the end

466
00:24:03,314 --> 00:24:04,196
of this.

467
00:24:04,196 --> 00:24:07,447
Right in the reason why we
have a convolutional network

468
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,659
for the encoder and an
upconvolutional network

469
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:14,409
for the decoder is because at
the encoder we're basically

470
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:16,890
taking it from this high
dimensional input to these lower

471
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,394
dimensional features and now
we want to go the other way

472
00:24:20,394 --> 00:24:22,810
go from our low dimensional
features back out to our

473
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,893
high dimensional reconstructed input.

474
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:33,248
And so in order to get this
effect that we said we wanted

475
00:24:33,248 --> 00:24:36,602
before of being able to
reconstruct our input data

476
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:39,071
we'll use something like
an L2 loss function.

477
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:42,220
Right that basically just
says let me make my pixels

478
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,764
of my input data to be the same as my,

479
00:24:44,764 --> 00:24:46,723
my pixels in my reconstructed
data to be the same

480
00:24:46,723 --> 00:24:49,306
as the pixels of my input data.

481
00:24:51,078 --> 00:24:53,032
An important thing to notice here,

482
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:55,147
this relates back to a
question that we had earlier,

483
00:24:55,147 --> 00:24:58,599
is that even though we have
this loss function here,

484
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,431
there's no, there's no external
labels that are being used

485
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:02,515
in training this.

486
00:25:02,515 --> 00:25:06,337
All we have is our training
data that we're going to use

487
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:09,361
both to pass through the
network as well as to compute

488
00:25:09,361 --> 00:25:10,861
our loss function.

489
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:17,082
So once we have this
after training this model

490
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,021
what we can do is we can
throw away this decoder.

491
00:25:19,021 --> 00:25:22,627
All this was used was too
to be able to produce our

492
00:25:22,627 --> 00:25:24,937
reconstruction input and
be able to compute our loss

493
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:26,108
function.

494
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:29,526
And we can use the encoder
that we have which produces our

495
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:32,960
feature mapping and we
can use this to initialize

496
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,819
a supervised model.

497
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:37,647
Right and so for example we
can now go from this input

498
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:42,447
to our features and then
have an additional classifier

499
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:45,773
network on top of this that
now we can use to output

500
00:25:45,773 --> 00:25:49,901
a class label for example for
classification problem

501
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:52,808
we can have external labels from here

502
00:25:52,808 --> 00:25:55,601
and use our standard loss
functions like Softmax.

503
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:58,157
And so the value of this is
that we basically were able

504
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:01,046
to use a lot of unlabeled
training data to try and learn

505
00:26:01,046 --> 00:26:04,449
good general feature representations.

506
00:26:04,449 --> 00:26:08,107
Right, and now we can use this
to initialize a supervised

507
00:26:08,107 --> 00:26:10,834
learning problem where sometimes
we don't have so much data

508
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:12,363
we only have small data.

509
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:16,363
And we've seen in previous
homeworks and classes

510
00:26:17,336 --> 00:26:19,697
that with small data it's
hard to learn a model, right?

511
00:26:19,697 --> 00:26:22,563
You can have over fitting
and all kinds of problems

512
00:26:22,563 --> 00:26:25,790
and so this allows you to
initialize your model first

513
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,540
with better features.

514
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:34,489
Okay so we saw that autoencoders
are able to reconstruct

515
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:38,518
data and are able to, as
a result, learn features

516
00:26:38,518 --> 00:26:41,243
to initialize, that we can
use to initialize a supervised

517
00:26:41,243 --> 00:26:42,329
model.

518
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:44,453
And we saw that these
features that we learned

519
00:26:44,453 --> 00:26:47,474
have this intuition of being
able to capture factors

520
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:50,133
of variation in the training data.

521
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:53,262
All right so based on this
intuition of okay these,

522
00:26:53,262 --> 00:26:56,953
we can have this latent
this vector Z which has

523
00:26:56,953 --> 00:26:58,941
factors of variation in our training data.

524
00:26:58,941 --> 00:27:02,290
Now a natural question is
well can we use a similar type

525
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,957
of setup to generate new images?

526
00:27:06,922 --> 00:27:09,502
And so now we will talk about
variational autoencoders

527
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,828
which is a probabillstic spin
on autoencoders that will let

528
00:27:11,828 --> 00:27:15,987
us sample from the model in
order to generate new data.

529
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:19,404
Okay any questions on autoencoders first?

530
00:27:20,796 --> 00:27:22,828
Okay, so variational autoencoders.

531
00:27:22,828 --> 00:27:26,414
All right so here we assume
that our training data

532
00:27:26,414 --> 00:27:28,914
that we have X I from one to N

533
00:27:30,255 --> 00:27:32,751
is generated from some
underlying, unobserved

534
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,812
latent representation Z.

535
00:27:34,812 --> 00:27:38,357
Right, so it's this intuition
that Z is some vector

536
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:41,891
right which element of Z
is capturing how little

537
00:27:41,891 --> 00:27:45,319
or how much of some factor
of variation that we have

538
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:47,069
in our training data.

539
00:27:48,491 --> 00:27:51,118
Right so the intuition is,
you know, maybe these could

540
00:27:51,118 --> 00:27:52,971
be something like different
kinds of attributes.

541
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,811
Let's say we're trying to generate faces,

542
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:57,791
it could be how much of
a smile is on the face,

543
00:27:57,791 --> 00:28:00,236
it could be position of the eyebrows hair

544
00:28:00,236 --> 00:28:02,608
orientation of the head.

545
00:28:02,608 --> 00:28:07,270
These are all possible
types of latent factors

546
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,772
that could be learned.

547
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:11,282
Right, and so our generation
process is that we're going to

548
00:28:11,282 --> 00:28:13,901
sample from a prior over Z.

549
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:17,299
Right so for each of these
attributes for example,

550
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:19,202
you know, how much smile that there is,

551
00:28:19,202 --> 00:28:22,172
we can have a prior over
what sort of distribution

552
00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:25,014
we think that there should be for this so,

553
00:28:25,014 --> 00:28:28,035
a gaussian is something
that's a natural prior

554
00:28:28,035 --> 00:28:31,571
that we can use for each
of these factors of Z

555
00:28:31,571 --> 00:28:34,345
and then we're going
to generate our data X

556
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:38,416
by sampling from a conditional,
conditional distribution

557
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,140
P of X given Z.

558
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,019
So we sample Z first, we sample
a value for each of these

559
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:46,112
latent factors and then we'll use that

560
00:28:46,112 --> 00:28:48,862
and sample our image X from here.

561
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:54,665
And so the true parameters
of this generation process

562
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:57,667
are theta, theta star right?

563
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,961
So we have the parameters of our prior

564
00:28:59,961 --> 00:29:03,158
and our conditional distributions

565
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,102
and what we want to do is in
order to have a generative

566
00:29:06,102 --> 00:29:07,560
model be able to generate new data

567
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,727
we want to estimate these
parameters of our true parameters

568
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,694
Okay so let's first talk
about how should we represent

569
00:29:16,694 --> 00:29:17,611
this model.

570
00:29:20,282 --> 00:29:22,252
All right, so if we're going to
have a model for this generator

571
00:29:22,252 --> 00:29:25,021
process, well we've already
said before that we can choose

572
00:29:25,021 --> 00:29:27,317
our prior P of Z to be something simple.

573
00:29:27,317 --> 00:29:28,919
Something like a Gaussian, right?

574
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:30,880
And this is the reasonable
thing to choose for

575
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,713
for latent attributes.

576
00:29:35,696 --> 00:29:39,260
Now for our conditional
distribution P of X given Z

577
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,840
this is much more complex right,

578
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,410
because we need to use
this to generate an image

579
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,918
and so for P of X given
Z, well as we saw before,

580
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,395
when we have some type of
complex function that we want

581
00:29:49,395 --> 00:29:53,062
to represent we can represent
this with a neural network.

582
00:29:53,062 --> 00:29:55,176
And so that's a natural
choice for let's try and model

583
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:58,259
P of X given Z with a neural network.

584
00:30:00,308 --> 00:30:02,345
And we're going to call
this the decoder network.

585
00:30:02,345 --> 00:30:04,756
Right, so we're going to
think about taking some latent

586
00:30:04,756 --> 00:30:08,327
representation and trying to
decode this into the image

587
00:30:08,327 --> 00:30:10,167
that it's specifying.

588
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:13,765
So now how can we train this model?

589
00:30:13,765 --> 00:30:15,699
Right, we want to be able to
train this model so that we can

590
00:30:15,699 --> 00:30:19,419
learn an estimate of these parameters.

591
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:21,985
So if we remember our strategy
from training generative

592
00:30:21,985 --> 00:30:24,668
models, back from are fully
visible belief networks,

593
00:30:24,668 --> 00:30:26,668
our pixelRNNs and CNNs,

594
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,492
a straightforward natural
strategy is to try

595
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:33,809
and learn these model
parameters in order to maximize

596
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:35,498
the likelihood of the training data.

597
00:30:35,498 --> 00:30:36,850
Right, so we saw earlier
that in this case,

598
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,346
with our latent variable
Z, we're going to have

599
00:30:39,346 --> 00:30:42,771
to write out P of X taking
expectation over all possible

600
00:30:42,771 --> 00:30:45,311
values of Z which is
continuous and so we get this

601
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:46,886
expression here.

602
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,884
Right so now we have it with this latent Z

603
00:30:49,884 --> 00:30:53,658
and now if we're going to, if
you want to try and maximize

604
00:30:53,658 --> 00:30:55,759
its likelihood, well what's the problem?

605
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,301
Can we just take this take
gradients and maximize

606
00:30:59,301 --> 00:31:01,372
this likelihood?

607
00:31:01,372 --> 00:31:04,358
[student's words obscured
due to lack of microphone]

608
00:31:04,358 --> 00:31:07,274
Right, so this integral is
not going to be tractable,

609
00:31:07,274 --> 00:31:08,524
that's correct.

610
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:12,547
So let's take a look at this
in a little bit more detail.

611
00:31:12,547 --> 00:31:15,911
Right, so we have our
data likelihood term here.

612
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:18,772
And the first time is P of Z.

613
00:31:18,772 --> 00:31:20,921
And here we already said
earlier, we can just choose this

614
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:24,847
to be a simple Gaussian
prior, so this is fine.

615
00:31:24,847 --> 00:31:26,532
P of X given Z, well we
said we were going to

616
00:31:26,532 --> 00:31:29,031
specify a decoder neural network.

617
00:31:29,031 --> 00:31:32,774
So given any Z, we can get
P of X given Z from here.

618
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:35,721
It's the output of our neural network.

619
00:31:35,721 --> 00:31:38,147
But then what's the problem here?

620
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:42,450
Okay this was supposed to
be a different unhappy face

621
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,495
but somehow I don't know what happened,

622
00:31:44,495 --> 00:31:45,518
in the process of translation,

623
00:31:45,518 --> 00:31:48,435
it turned into a crying black ghost

624
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:53,465
but what this is symbolizing
is that basically if we want

625
00:31:54,393 --> 00:31:55,855
to compute P of X given Z

626
00:31:55,855 --> 00:31:59,519
for every Z this is now intractable right,

627
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,186
we cannot compute this integral.

628
00:32:04,794 --> 00:32:06,591
So data likelihood is intractable

629
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,486
and it turns out that if
we look at other terms

630
00:32:10,486 --> 00:32:12,901
in this model if we look
at our posterior density,

631
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:15,818
So P of our posterior of Z given X,

632
00:32:16,921 --> 00:32:19,639
then this is going to be P of X given Z

633
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:23,712
times P of Z over P of X by Bayes' rule

634
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:25,740
and this is also going
to be intractable, right.

635
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,230
We have P of X given Z
is okay, P of Z is okay,

636
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:31,476
but we have this P of X our likelihood

637
00:32:31,476 --> 00:32:35,143
which has the integral
and it's intractable.

638
00:32:36,027 --> 00:32:37,993
So we can't directly optimizes this.

639
00:32:37,993 --> 00:32:40,493
but we'll see that a solution,

640
00:32:42,463 --> 00:32:45,230
a solution that will enable
us to learn this model

641
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,153
is if in addition to
using a decoder network

642
00:32:48,153 --> 00:32:50,997
defining this neural network
to model P of X given Z.

643
00:32:50,997 --> 00:32:54,824
If we now define an
additional encoder network

644
00:32:54,824 --> 00:32:57,887
Q of Z given X we're going
to call this an encoder

645
00:32:57,887 --> 00:33:01,776
because we want to turn our input X into,

646
00:33:01,776 --> 00:33:04,414
get the likelihood of Z given X,

647
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:06,652
we're going to encode this into Z.

648
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,746
And defined this network to approximate

649
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:10,329
the P of Z given X.

650
00:33:12,388 --> 00:33:14,517
Right this was posterior
density term now is also

651
00:33:14,517 --> 00:33:15,688
intractable.

652
00:33:15,688 --> 00:33:20,396
If we use this additional
network to approximate this

653
00:33:20,396 --> 00:33:22,866
then we'll see that this will
actually allow us to derive

654
00:33:22,866 --> 00:33:25,319
a lower bound on the data
likelihood that is tractable

655
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:27,486
and which we can optimize.

656
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:31,229
Okay so first just to be a
little bit more concrete about

657
00:33:31,229 --> 00:33:35,396
these encoder and decoder
networks that I specified,

658
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:39,156
in variational autoencoders we
want the model probabilistic

659
00:33:39,156 --> 00:33:40,695
generation of data.

660
00:33:40,695 --> 00:33:42,334
So in autoencoders we already talked

661
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:45,647
about this concept of having
an encoder going from input X

662
00:33:45,647 --> 00:33:49,447
to some feature Z and a
decoder network going from Z

663
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:51,530
back out to some image X.

664
00:33:53,294 --> 00:33:55,927
And so here we go to again
have an encoder network

665
00:33:55,927 --> 00:33:57,462
and a decoder network but we're going

666
00:33:57,462 --> 00:33:58,907
to make these probabilistic.

667
00:33:58,907 --> 00:34:02,433
So now our encoder network
Q of Z given X with

668
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:06,134
parameters phi are going to output a mean

669
00:34:06,134 --> 00:34:09,467
and a diagonal covariance and from here,

670
00:34:11,411 --> 00:34:13,433
this will be the direct
outputs of our encoder

671
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:14,795
network and the same thing for our

672
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:17,637
decoder network which
is going to start from Z

673
00:34:17,637 --> 00:34:19,600
and now it's going to output the mean

674
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,109
and the diagonal covariance of some X,

675
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:26,725
same dimension as the input given Z

676
00:34:26,725 --> 00:34:28,645
And then this decoder network
has different parameters

677
00:34:28,645 --> 00:34:29,478
theta.

678
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:35,053
And now in order to
actually get our Z and our,

679
00:34:36,494 --> 00:34:40,436
This should be Z given X and X given Z.

680
00:34:40,436 --> 00:34:42,058
We'll sample from these distributions.

681
00:34:42,058 --> 00:34:44,387
So now our encoder and our decoder network

682
00:34:44,387 --> 00:34:49,072
are producing distributions
over Z and X respectively

683
00:34:49,072 --> 00:34:50,706
and will sample from this distribution

684
00:34:50,706 --> 00:34:52,409
in order to get a value from here.

685
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:54,641
So you can see how this is
taking us on the direction

686
00:34:54,641 --> 00:34:59,630
towards being able to sample
and generate new data.

687
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,983
And just one thing to note is that

688
00:35:00,983 --> 00:35:02,855
these encoder and decoder networks,

689
00:35:02,855 --> 00:35:05,041
you'll also hear different terms for them.

690
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:07,944
The encoder network can
also be kind of recognition

691
00:35:07,944 --> 00:35:09,138
or inference network because

692
00:35:09,138 --> 00:35:12,888
we're trying to form
inference of this latent

693
00:35:12,888 --> 00:35:15,913
representation of Z given
X and then for the decoder

694
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,826
network, this is what we'll
use to perform generation.

695
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:22,993
Right so you also hear
generation network being used.

696
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:28,186
Okay so now equipped with our
encoder and decoder networks,

697
00:35:28,186 --> 00:35:31,899
let's try and work out
the data likelihood again.

698
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:35,117
and we'll use the log of
the data likelihood here.

699
00:35:35,117 --> 00:35:38,833
So we'll see that if we
want the log of P of X right

700
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:40,957
we can write this out as like a P of X but

701
00:35:40,957 --> 00:35:44,988
take the expectation with respect to Z.

702
00:35:44,988 --> 00:35:46,738
So Z samples from our

703
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:50,801
distribution of Q of Z given
X that we've now defined

704
00:35:50,801 --> 00:35:52,606
using the encoder network.

705
00:35:52,606 --> 00:35:55,477
And we can do this because
P of X doesn't depend on Z.

706
00:35:55,477 --> 00:35:58,254
Right 'cause Z is not part of that.

707
00:35:58,254 --> 00:36:01,461
And so we'll see that taking
the expectation with respect

708
00:36:01,461 --> 00:36:04,794
to Z is going to come in handy later on.

709
00:36:06,255 --> 00:36:10,350
Okay so now from this
original expression we can

710
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:14,332
now expand it out to be
log of P of X given Z,

711
00:36:14,332 --> 00:36:17,576
P of Z over P of Z given
X using Bayes' rule.

712
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:20,564
And so this is just
directly writing this out.

713
00:36:20,564 --> 00:36:23,763
And then taking this we
can also now multiply it

714
00:36:23,763 --> 00:36:24,996
by a constant.

715
00:36:24,996 --> 00:36:28,937
Right, so Q of Z given
X over Q of Z given X.

716
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,874
This is one we can do this.

717
00:36:30,874 --> 00:36:33,847
It doesn't change it but it's
going to be helpful later on.

718
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:36,899
So given that what we'll
do is we'll write it

719
00:36:36,899 --> 00:36:39,444
out into these three separate terms.

720
00:36:39,444 --> 00:36:41,567
And you can work out this
math later on by yourself

721
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:44,703
but it's essentially just
using logarithm rules

722
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,449
taking all of these
terms that we had in the

723
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:50,561
line above and just separating it out into

724
00:36:50,561 --> 00:36:54,728
these three different terms
that will have nice meanings.

725
00:36:56,431 --> 00:36:58,758
Right so if we look at this,
the first term that we get

726
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,754
separated out is log of P
given X and then expectation

727
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:05,560
of log of P given X and
then we're going to have

728
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,210
two KL terms, right.

729
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:10,210
This is basically KL divergence term

730
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:14,400
to say how close these two distributions are.

731
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,567
So how close is a distribution
Q of Z given X to P of Z.

732
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:24,287
So it's just the, it's exactly
this expectation term above.

733
00:37:24,287 --> 00:37:28,454
And it's just a distance
metric for distributions.

734
00:37:30,908 --> 00:37:33,332
And so we'll see that,
right, we saw that these are

735
00:37:33,332 --> 00:37:36,183
nice KL terms that we can write out.

736
00:37:36,183 --> 00:37:39,290
And now if we look at these
three terms that we have here,

737
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,806
the first term is P of X
given Z, which is provided

738
00:37:43,806 --> 00:37:45,819
by our decoder network.

739
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:48,873
And we're able to compute
an estimate of these term

740
00:37:48,873 --> 00:37:52,042
through sampling and we'll see that we can

741
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:54,160
do a sampling that's
differentiable through something

742
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,099
called the re-parametrization
trick which is a

743
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,932
detail that you can look
at this paper if you're

744
00:37:58,932 --> 00:37:59,920
interested.

745
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,479
But basically we can
now compute this term.

746
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:06,398
And then these KL terms,
the second KL term

747
00:38:06,398 --> 00:38:08,600
is a KL between two Gaussians,

748
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,964
so our Q of Z given X,
remember our encoder produced

749
00:38:11,964 --> 00:38:14,608
this distribution which had
a mean and a covariance,

750
00:38:14,608 --> 00:38:16,079
it was a nice Gaussian.

751
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,892
And then also our prior P of
Z which is also a Gaussian.

752
00:38:19,892 --> 00:38:22,058
And so this has a nice, when you have a KL

753
00:38:22,058 --> 00:38:24,513
of two Gaussians you have
a nice closed form solution

754
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:25,628
that you can have.

755
00:38:25,628 --> 00:38:27,324
And then this third KL term now,

756
00:38:27,324 --> 00:38:31,324
this is a KL of Q given
X with a P of Z given X.

757
00:38:32,303 --> 00:38:35,311
But we know that P of Z
given X was this intractable

758
00:38:35,311 --> 00:38:36,766
posterior that we saw earlier, right?

759
00:38:36,766 --> 00:38:38,922
That we didn't want to
compute that's why we had

760
00:38:38,922 --> 00:38:41,794
this approximation using Q.

761
00:38:41,794 --> 00:38:44,625
And so this term is still is a problem.

762
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:47,102
But one thing we do know
about this term is that KL

763
00:38:47,102 --> 00:38:50,609
divergence, it's a distance
between two distributions

764
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:54,776
is always greater than or
equal to zero by definition.

765
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,058
And so what we can do with this is that,

766
00:38:59,058 --> 00:39:01,257
well what we have here, the
two terms that we can work

767
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:03,396
nicely with, this is a,

768
00:39:03,396 --> 00:39:06,935
this is a tractable lower
bound which we can actually

769
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:10,023
take gradient of and optimize.

770
00:39:10,023 --> 00:39:12,781
P of X given Z is
differentiable and the KL terms

771
00:39:12,781 --> 00:39:16,652
are also, the close form
solution is also differentiable.

772
00:39:16,652 --> 00:39:19,213
And this is a lower bound
because we know that the KL

773
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:22,686
term on the right, the
ugly one is greater than

774
00:39:22,686 --> 00:39:24,168
or equal it zero.

775
00:39:24,168 --> 00:39:26,251
So we have a lower bound.

776
00:39:27,273 --> 00:39:32,224
And so what we'll do to train
a variational autoencoder

777
00:39:32,224 --> 00:39:35,155
is that we take this
lower bound and we instead

778
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:37,699
optimize and maximize
this lower bound instead.

779
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:40,777
So we're optimizing a lower
bound on the likelihood

780
00:39:40,777 --> 00:39:42,251
of our data.

781
00:39:42,251 --> 00:39:45,031
So that means that our data
is always going to have

782
00:39:45,031 --> 00:39:47,554
a likelihood that's at
least as high as this lower

783
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:49,940
bound that we're maximizing.

784
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,607
And so we want to find
the parameters theta,

785
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:59,042
estimate parameters theta
and phi that allows us to

786
00:40:00,162 --> 00:40:01,329
maximize this.

787
00:40:03,169 --> 00:40:06,412
And then one last sort of
intuition about this lower bound

788
00:40:06,412 --> 00:40:09,132
that we have is that this first term

789
00:40:09,132 --> 00:40:12,796
is expectation over all samples of Z

790
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:16,963
sampled from passing our X
through the encoder network

791
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:21,836
sampling Z taking expectation
over all of these samples

792
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,003
of likelihood of X given Z

793
00:40:24,963 --> 00:40:26,854
and so this is a reconstruction, right?

794
00:40:26,854 --> 00:40:29,196
This is basically saying,
if I want this to be big

795
00:40:29,196 --> 00:40:33,300
I want this likelihood P
of X given Z to be high,

796
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,168
so it's kind of like
trying to do a good job

797
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:37,756
reconstructing the data.

798
00:40:37,756 --> 00:40:40,528
So similar to what we had
from our autoencoder before.

799
00:40:40,528 --> 00:40:44,695
But the second term here is
saying make this KL small.

800
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:48,832
Make our approximate
posterior distribution close

801
00:40:48,832 --> 00:40:51,283
to our prior distribution.

802
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:55,450
And this basically is
saying that well we want our

803
00:40:56,633 --> 00:40:59,883
latent variable Z to be following this,

804
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:05,338
have this distribution
type, distribution shape

805
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,838
that we would like it to have.

806
00:41:08,974 --> 00:41:12,058
Okay so any questions about this?

807
00:41:12,058 --> 00:41:14,486
I think this is a lot
of math that if you guys

808
00:41:14,486 --> 00:41:17,440
are interested you should go
back and kind of work through

809
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,128
all of the derivations yourself.

810
00:41:19,128 --> 00:41:19,961
Yeah.

811
00:41:20,883 --> 00:41:23,669
[student's words obscured
due to lack of microphone]

812
00:41:23,669 --> 00:41:26,928
So the question is why
do we specify the prior

813
00:41:26,928 --> 00:41:29,373
and the latent variables as Gaussian?

814
00:41:29,373 --> 00:41:31,523
And the reason is that well we're defining

815
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:33,512
some sort of generative process right,

816
00:41:33,512 --> 00:41:35,930
of sampling Z first and
then sampling X first.

817
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,444
And defining it as a
Gaussian is a reasonable type

818
00:41:39,444 --> 00:41:43,611
of prior that we can say
makes sense for these types

819
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,619
of latent attributes to
be distributed according

820
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:51,724
to some sort of Gaussian, and
then this lets us now then

821
00:41:51,724 --> 00:41:53,307
optimize our model.

822
00:41:55,988 --> 00:42:00,211
Okay, so we talked about how
we can deride this lower bound

823
00:42:00,211 --> 00:42:03,725
and now let's put this all
together and walk through

824
00:42:03,725 --> 00:42:06,053
the process of the training of the AE.

825
00:42:06,053 --> 00:42:08,802
Right so here's the bound
that we want to optimize,

826
00:42:08,802 --> 00:42:10,008
to maximize.

827
00:42:10,008 --> 00:42:12,057
And now for a forward pass.

828
00:42:12,057 --> 00:42:14,864
We're going to proceed
in the following manner.

829
00:42:14,864 --> 00:42:18,134
We have our input data
X, so we'll a mini batch

830
00:42:18,134 --> 00:42:19,301
of input data.

831
00:42:20,845 --> 00:42:24,211
And then we'll pass it
through our encoder network

832
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,544
so we'll get Q of Z given X.

833
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:33,384
And from this Q of Z given
X, this'll be the terms

834
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,805
that we use to compute the KL term.

835
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:40,606
And then from here we'll
sample Z from this distribution

836
00:42:40,606 --> 00:42:44,773
of Z given X so we have a
sample of the latent factors

837
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,203
that we can infer from X.

838
00:42:50,721 --> 00:42:52,543
And then from here we're
going to pass a Z through

839
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,889
another, our second decoder network.

840
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:56,999
And from the decoder network
we'll get this output

841
00:42:56,999 --> 00:43:00,150
for the mean and variance
on our distribution for

842
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:03,817
X given Z and then
finally we can sample now

843
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:07,686
our X given Z from this distribution

844
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:12,155
and here this will produce
some sample output.

845
00:43:12,155 --> 00:43:13,676
And when we're training
we're going to take this

846
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:16,500
distribution and say well
our loss term is going to be

847
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,417
log of our training image
pixel values given Z.

848
00:43:23,612 --> 00:43:26,517
So our loss functions going
to say let's maximize the

849
00:43:26,517 --> 00:43:30,684
likelihood of this original
input being reconstructed.

850
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,086
And so now for every mini batch of input

851
00:43:34,086 --> 00:43:35,919
we're going to compute this forward pass.

852
00:43:35,919 --> 00:43:37,770
Get all these terms that we need

853
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:40,290
and then this is all
differentiable so then we just

854
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:43,837
backprop though all of this
and then get our gradient,

855
00:43:43,837 --> 00:43:47,194
we update our model and
we use this to continuously

856
00:43:47,194 --> 00:43:50,763
update our parameters,
our generator and decoder

857
00:43:50,763 --> 00:43:54,123
network parameters theta
and phi in order to maximize

858
00:43:54,123 --> 00:43:57,040
the likelihood of the trained data.

859
00:43:58,408 --> 00:44:01,084
Okay so once we've trained our VAE,

860
00:44:01,084 --> 00:44:03,508
so now to generate data,
what we can do is we can

861
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:05,547
use just the decoder network.

862
00:44:05,547 --> 00:44:07,919
All right, so from here
we can sample Z now,

863
00:44:07,919 --> 00:44:10,947
instead of sampling Z from
this posterior that we had

864
00:44:10,947 --> 00:44:13,805
during training, while
during generation we sample

865
00:44:13,805 --> 00:44:15,504
from our true generative process.

866
00:44:15,504 --> 00:44:18,673
So we sample from our
prior that we specify.

867
00:44:18,673 --> 00:44:22,840
And then we're going to then
sample our data X from here.

868
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:27,606
And we'll see that this
can produce, in this case,

869
00:44:27,606 --> 00:44:32,465
train on MNIST, these are
samples of digits generated

870
00:44:32,465 --> 00:44:34,798
from a VAE trained on MNIST.

871
00:44:36,058 --> 00:44:38,842
And you can see that, you
know, we talked about this idea

872
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:43,796
of Z representing these
latent factors where we can

873
00:44:43,796 --> 00:44:46,440
bury Z right according to
our sample from different

874
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,464
parts of our prior and
then get different kind of

875
00:44:50,464 --> 00:44:52,625
interpretable meanings from here.

876
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:54,207
So here we can see that this is

877
00:44:54,207 --> 00:44:57,142
the data manifold for two dimensional Z.

878
00:44:57,142 --> 00:44:59,718
So if we have a two dimensional
Z and we take Z and let's

879
00:44:59,718 --> 00:45:04,110
say some range from you know,
from different percentiles

880
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:08,568
of the distribution, and
we vary Z1 and we vary Z2,

881
00:45:08,568 --> 00:45:13,038
then you can see how the
image generated from every

882
00:45:13,038 --> 00:45:16,300
combination of Z1 and
Z2 that we have here,

883
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,587
you can see it's transitioning
smoothly across all

884
00:45:19,587 --> 00:45:22,087
of these different variations.

885
00:45:24,051 --> 00:45:27,808
And you know our prior on
Z was, it was diagonal,

886
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,387
so we chose this in order
to encourage this to be

887
00:45:30,387 --> 00:45:34,568
independent latent variables
that can then encode

888
00:45:34,568 --> 00:45:37,372
interpretable factors of variation.

889
00:45:37,372 --> 00:45:39,731
So because of this now we'll
have different dimensions

890
00:45:39,731 --> 00:45:41,923
of Z, encoding different
interpretable factors

891
00:45:41,923 --> 00:45:43,006
of variation.

892
00:45:44,477 --> 00:45:47,674
So, in this example train now on Faces,

893
00:45:47,674 --> 00:45:52,020
we'll see as we vary
Z1, going up and down,

894
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,771
you'll see the amount of smile changing.

895
00:45:54,771 --> 00:45:56,892
So from a frown at the
top to like a big smile

896
00:45:56,892 --> 00:46:00,225
at the bottom and then as we go vary Z2,

897
00:46:01,997 --> 00:46:04,192
from left to right, you can
see the head pose changing.

898
00:46:04,192 --> 00:46:07,859
From one direction all
the way to the other.

899
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:12,020
And so one additional
thing I want to point out

900
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,964
is that as a result of doing this,

901
00:46:13,964 --> 00:46:17,214
these Z variables are also good feature

902
00:46:18,198 --> 00:46:19,510
representations.

903
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:23,355
Because they encode how
much of these different

904
00:46:23,355 --> 00:46:26,376
these different interpretable
semantics that we have.

905
00:46:26,376 --> 00:46:29,466
And so we can use our Q of Z given X,

906
00:46:29,466 --> 00:46:32,296
the encoder that we've
learned and give it an input

907
00:46:32,296 --> 00:46:36,213
images X, we can map this
to Z and use the Z as

908
00:46:38,121 --> 00:46:40,198
features that we can
use for downstream tasks

909
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:43,157
like supervision, or
like classification or

910
00:46:43,157 --> 00:46:44,157
other tasks.

911
00:46:47,348 --> 00:46:49,947
Okay so just another
couple of examples of data

912
00:46:49,947 --> 00:46:51,434
generated from VAEs.

913
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:55,694
So on the left here we have
data generated on CIFAR-10,

914
00:46:55,694 --> 00:46:58,729
trained on CIFAR-10, and
then on the right we have

915
00:46:58,729 --> 00:47:02,231
data trained and generated on Faces.

916
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:05,043
And we'll see so we can
see that in general VAEs

917
00:47:05,043 --> 00:47:08,737
are able to generate recognizable data.

918
00:47:08,737 --> 00:47:11,796
One of the main drawbacks
of VAEs is that they tend

919
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:15,493
to still have a bit of
a blurry aspect to them.

920
00:47:15,493 --> 00:47:18,270
You can see this in the
faces and so this is still

921
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,520
an active area of research.

922
00:47:22,008 --> 00:47:24,944
Okay so to summarize VAEs,

923
00:47:24,944 --> 00:47:28,030
they're a probabilistic spin
on traditional autoencoders.

924
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:31,895
So instead of deterministically
taking your input X

925
00:47:31,895 --> 00:47:36,077
and going to Z, feature Z and
then back to reconstructing X,

926
00:47:36,077 --> 00:47:40,585
now we have this idea of
distributions and sampling

927
00:47:40,585 --> 00:47:43,023
involved which allows us to generate data.

928
00:47:43,023 --> 00:47:46,928
And in order to train
this, VAEs are defining an

929
00:47:46,928 --> 00:47:48,435
intractable density.

930
00:47:48,435 --> 00:47:51,101
So we can derive and
optimize a lower bound,

931
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:55,938
a variational lower bound, so
variational means basically

932
00:47:55,938 --> 00:47:58,621
using approximations to handle
these types of intractable

933
00:47:58,621 --> 00:47:59,718
expressions.

934
00:47:59,718 --> 00:48:03,577
And so this is why this is
called a variational autoencoder.

935
00:48:03,577 --> 00:48:07,188
And so some of the
advantages of this approach

936
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:10,249
is that VAEs are, they're
a principled approach

937
00:48:10,249 --> 00:48:14,230
to generative models and they
also allow this inference

938
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,628
query so being able to infer
things like Q of Z given X.

939
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:20,221
That we said could be useful
feature representations

940
00:48:20,221 --> 00:48:21,554
for other tasks.

941
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:27,081
So disadvantages of VAEs are
that while we're maximizing

942
00:48:27,081 --> 00:48:29,548
the lower bound of the
likelihood, which is okay

943
00:48:29,548 --> 00:48:32,303
like you know in general this
is still pushing us in the

944
00:48:32,303 --> 00:48:33,967
right direction and there's

945
00:48:33,967 --> 00:48:37,782
more other theoretical analysis of this.

946
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:41,700
So you know, it's doing okay,
but it's maybe not still

947
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:46,042
as direct an optimization
and evaluation as the pixel

948
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:48,378
RNNs and CNNs that we saw earlier,

949
00:48:48,378 --> 00:48:50,378
but which had, and then,

950
00:48:51,857 --> 00:48:55,431
also the VAE samples are
tending to be a little bit

951
00:48:55,431 --> 00:48:59,235
blurrier and of lower quality
compared to state of the art

952
00:48:59,235 --> 00:49:01,967
samples that we can see
from other generative models

953
00:49:01,967 --> 00:49:04,827
such as GANs that we'll talk about next.

954
00:49:04,827 --> 00:49:07,230
And so VAEs now are still,
they're still an active

955
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:08,647
area of research.

956
00:49:11,044 --> 00:49:13,447
People are working on more
flexible approximations,

957
00:49:13,447 --> 00:49:15,565
so richer approximate posteriors,

958
00:49:15,565 --> 00:49:19,611
so instead of just a
diagonal Gaussian some richer

959
00:49:19,611 --> 00:49:20,881
functions for this.

960
00:49:20,881 --> 00:49:23,977
And then also, another area
that people have been working

961
00:49:23,977 --> 00:49:26,159
on is incorporating more
structure in these latent

962
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:26,992
variables.

963
00:49:26,992 --> 00:49:31,282
So now we had all of these
independent latent variables

964
00:49:31,282 --> 00:49:34,327
but people are working on
having modeling structure

965
00:49:34,327 --> 00:49:38,077
in here, groupings,
other types of structure.

966
00:49:41,106 --> 00:49:43,106
Okay, so yeah, question.

967
00:49:44,404 --> 00:49:47,529
[student's words obscured
due to lack of microphone]

968
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:49,810
Yeah, so the question is we're
deciding the dimensionality

969
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,394
of the latent variable.

970
00:49:51,394 --> 00:49:54,727
Yeah, that's something that you specify.

971
00:49:55,874 --> 00:50:00,041
Okay, so we've talked so
far about pixelCNNs and VAEs

972
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:05,439
and now we'll take a look
at a third and very popular

973
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:08,522
type of generative model called GANs.

974
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:13,378
So the models that we've seen
so far, pixelCNNs and RNNs

975
00:50:13,378 --> 00:50:15,713
define a tractable density function.

976
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:19,752
And they optimize the
likelihood of the trained data.

977
00:50:19,752 --> 00:50:24,174
And then VAEs in contrast to
that now have this additional

978
00:50:24,174 --> 00:50:26,675
latent variable Z that they
define in the generative

979
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:27,752
process.

980
00:50:27,752 --> 00:50:31,206
And so having the Z has
a lot of nice properties

981
00:50:31,206 --> 00:50:34,242
that we talked about, but
they are also cause us to have

982
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:36,858
this intractable density
function that we can't

983
00:50:36,858 --> 00:50:39,813
optimize directly and so
we derive and optimize

984
00:50:39,813 --> 00:50:43,934
a lower bound on the likelihood instead.

985
00:50:43,934 --> 00:50:46,405
And so now what if we
just give up on explicitly

986
00:50:46,405 --> 00:50:48,486
modeling this density at all?

987
00:50:48,486 --> 00:50:51,100
And we say well what we
want is just the ability

988
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:55,267
to sample and to have nice
samples from our distribution.

989
00:50:56,501 --> 00:50:59,175
So this is the approach that GANs take.

990
00:50:59,175 --> 00:51:02,637
So in GANs we don't work with
an explicit density function,

991
00:51:02,637 --> 00:51:05,642
but instead we're going to
take a game-theoretic approach

992
00:51:05,642 --> 00:51:08,018
and we're going to learn to
generate from our training

993
00:51:08,018 --> 00:51:10,422
distribution through a set
up of a two player game,

994
00:51:10,422 --> 00:51:13,839
and we'll talk about this in more detail.

995
00:51:15,255 --> 00:51:18,654
So, in the GAN set up we're
saying, okay well what we want,

996
00:51:18,654 --> 00:51:21,354
what we care about is we
want to be able to sample

997
00:51:21,354 --> 00:51:24,681
from a complex high dimensional
training distribution.

998
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:27,339
So if we think about well
we want to produce samples

999
00:51:27,339 --> 00:51:29,885
from this distribution,
there's no direct way

1000
00:51:29,885 --> 00:51:31,170
that we can do this.

1001
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:32,560
We have this very complex distribution,

1002
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,078
we can't just take samples from here.

1003
00:51:35,078 --> 00:51:38,956
So the solution that we're
going to take is that we can,

1004
00:51:38,956 --> 00:51:42,895
however, sample from
simpler distributions.

1005
00:51:42,895 --> 00:51:44,687
For example random noise, right?

1006
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:46,875
Gaussians are, these we can sample from.

1007
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:49,414
And so what we're going to
do is we're going to learn

1008
00:51:49,414 --> 00:51:52,622
a transformation from
these simple distributions

1009
00:51:52,622 --> 00:51:56,789
directly to the training
distribution that we want.

1010
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:03,221
So the question, what can we
used to represent this complex

1011
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:04,304
distribution?

1012
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,718
Neural network, I heard the answer.

1013
00:52:07,718 --> 00:52:10,362
So when we want to model
some kind of complex function

1014
00:52:10,362 --> 00:52:14,373
or transformation we use a neural network.

1015
00:52:14,373 --> 00:52:17,478
Okay so what we're going to
do is we're going to take

1016
00:52:17,478 --> 00:52:19,702
in the GAN set up, we're
going to take some input

1017
00:52:19,702 --> 00:52:23,297
which is a vector of some
dimension that we specify

1018
00:52:23,297 --> 00:52:26,060
of random noise and then we're
going to pass this through

1019
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,015
a generator network, and then
we're going to get as output

1020
00:52:29,015 --> 00:52:33,628
directly a sample from
the training distribution.

1021
00:52:33,628 --> 00:52:36,821
So every input of random
noise we want to correspond to

1022
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:40,154
a sample from the training distribution.

1023
00:52:41,278 --> 00:52:44,763
And so the way we're going to
train and learn this network

1024
00:52:44,763 --> 00:52:48,737
is that we're going to look
at this as a two player game.

1025
00:52:48,737 --> 00:52:50,721
So we have two players, a
generator network as well

1026
00:52:50,721 --> 00:52:54,595
as an additional discriminator
network that I'll show next.

1027
00:52:54,595 --> 00:52:59,080
And our generator network is
going to try to, as player one,

1028
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,584
it's going to try to fool the
discriminator by generating

1029
00:53:02,584 --> 00:53:04,320
real looking images.

1030
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,089
And then our second player,
our discriminator network

1031
00:53:07,089 --> 00:53:11,629
is then going to try to
distinguish between real and fake

1032
00:53:11,629 --> 00:53:12,462
images.

1033
00:53:12,462 --> 00:53:16,950
So it wants to do as good
a job as possible of trying

1034
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:19,740
to determine which of these
images are counterfeit

1035
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,323
or fake images generated
by this generator.

1036
00:53:25,425 --> 00:53:27,324
Okay so what this looks like is,

1037
00:53:27,324 --> 00:53:31,203
we have our random noise going
to our generator network,

1038
00:53:31,203 --> 00:53:33,678
generator network is generating
these images that we're

1039
00:53:33,678 --> 00:53:36,121
going to call, they're
fake from our generator.

1040
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:38,738
And then we're going to also
have real images that we

1041
00:53:38,738 --> 00:53:42,439
take from our training
set and then we want the

1042
00:53:42,439 --> 00:53:46,356
discriminator to be able
to distinguish between

1043
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,881
real and fake images.

1044
00:53:50,881 --> 00:53:52,849
Output real and fake for each images.

1045
00:53:52,849 --> 00:53:55,779
So the idea is if we're
able to have a very good

1046
00:53:55,779 --> 00:53:57,910
discriminator, we want to
train a good discriminator,

1047
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:01,638
if it can do a good job of
discriminating real versus fake,

1048
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:05,760
and then if our generator
network is able to generate,

1049
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,227
if it's able to do well
and generate fake images

1050
00:54:08,227 --> 00:54:11,140
that can successfully
fool this discriminator,

1051
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:13,135
then we have a good generative model.

1052
00:54:13,135 --> 00:54:16,348
We're generating images that
look like images from the

1053
00:54:16,348 --> 00:54:17,431
training set.

1054
00:54:19,482 --> 00:54:22,421
Okay, so we have these two
players and so we're going to

1055
00:54:22,421 --> 00:54:25,548
train this jointly in a
minimax game formulation.

1056
00:54:25,548 --> 00:54:28,941
So this minimax objective
function is what we have here.

1057
00:54:28,941 --> 00:54:33,108
We're going to take, it's going
to be minimum over theta G

1058
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:37,399
our parameters of our generator network G,

1059
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:41,431
and maximum over parameter Zeta
of our Discriminator network

1060
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:44,848
D, of this objective, right, these terms.

1061
00:54:47,177 --> 00:54:49,624
And so if we look at these
terms, what this is saying

1062
00:54:49,624 --> 00:54:53,243
is well this first thing,
expectation over data

1063
00:54:53,243 --> 00:54:54,910
of log of D given X.

1064
00:54:56,094 --> 00:54:59,496
This log of D of X is
the discriminator output

1065
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:01,151
for real data X.

1066
00:55:01,151 --> 00:55:05,318
This is going to be likelihood
of real data being real

1067
00:55:06,978 --> 00:55:09,309
from the data distribution P data.

1068
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:12,963
And then the second term
here, expectation of Z drawn

1069
00:55:12,963 --> 00:55:16,882
from P of Z, Z drawn from
P of Z means samples from

1070
00:55:16,882 --> 00:55:21,049
our generator network and
this term D of G of Z that

1071
00:55:22,581 --> 00:55:25,875
we have here is the output
of our discriminator

1072
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:29,109
for generated fake data for our,

1073
00:55:29,109 --> 00:55:32,602
what does the discriminator
output of G of Z which is

1074
00:55:32,602 --> 00:55:33,769
our fake data.

1075
00:55:36,311 --> 00:55:39,678
And so if we think about
this is trying to do,

1076
00:55:39,678 --> 00:55:43,105
our discriminator wants to
maximize this objective, right,

1077
00:55:43,105 --> 00:55:47,272
it's a max over theta D such
that D of X is close to one.

1078
00:55:49,271 --> 00:55:53,278
It's close to real, it's
high for the real data.

1079
00:55:53,278 --> 00:55:57,445
And then D of G of X, what
it thinks of the fake data

1080
00:55:58,696 --> 00:56:02,679
on the left here is small, we
want this to be close to zero.

1081
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:06,341
So if we're able to maximize
this, this means discriminator

1082
00:56:06,341 --> 00:56:09,237
is doing a good job of
distinguishing between real and zero.

1083
00:56:09,237 --> 00:56:13,449
Basically classifying
between real and fake data.

1084
00:56:13,449 --> 00:56:17,092
And then our generator, here
we want the generator to

1085
00:56:17,092 --> 00:56:21,542
minimize this objective such
that D of G of Z is close

1086
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:22,375
to one.

1087
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:26,329
So if this D of G of Z is
close to one over here,

1088
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:31,319
then the one minus side is
small and basically we want to,

1089
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:35,236
if we minimize this term
then, then it's having

1090
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,175
discriminator think that our
fake data's actually real.

1091
00:56:39,175 --> 00:56:44,087
So that means that our generator
is producing real samples.

1092
00:56:44,087 --> 00:56:46,893
Okay so this is the
important objective of GANs

1093
00:56:46,893 --> 00:56:51,139
to try and understand so are
there any questions about this?

1094
00:56:51,139 --> 00:56:55,306
[student's words obscured
due to lack of microphone]

1095
00:57:02,342 --> 00:57:04,229
I'm not sure I understand
your question, can you,

1096
00:57:04,229 --> 00:57:08,396
[student's words obscured
due to lack of microphone]

1097
00:57:12,334 --> 00:57:15,377
Yeah, so the question is
is this basically trying

1098
00:57:15,377 --> 00:57:19,544
to have the first network
produce real looking images

1099
00:57:20,761 --> 00:57:22,617
that our second network,
the discriminator cannot

1100
00:57:22,617 --> 00:57:24,284
distinguish between.

1101
00:57:30,474 --> 00:57:34,174
Okay, so the question is how
do we actually label the data

1102
00:57:34,174 --> 00:57:36,809
or do the training for these networks.

1103
00:57:36,809 --> 00:57:39,364
We'll see how to train the networks next.

1104
00:57:39,364 --> 00:57:43,530
But in terms of like what
is the data label basically,

1105
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:46,180
this is unsupervised, so
there's no data labeling.

1106
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:49,541
But data generated from
the generator network,

1107
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:52,805
the fake images have a label
of basically zero or fake.

1108
00:57:52,805 --> 00:57:56,913
And we can take training
images that are real images

1109
00:57:56,913 --> 00:58:00,344
and this basically has
a label of one or real.

1110
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:03,692
So when we have, the loss
function for our discriminator

1111
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:04,866
is using this.

1112
00:58:04,866 --> 00:58:08,157
It's trying to output a zero
for the generator images

1113
00:58:08,157 --> 00:58:09,819
and a one for the real images.

1114
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,048
So there's no external labels.

1115
00:58:12,048 --> 00:58:15,136
[student's words obscured
due to lack of microphone]

1116
00:58:15,136 --> 00:58:17,554
So the question is the label
for the generator network

1117
00:58:17,554 --> 00:58:22,119
will be the output for
the discriminator network.

1118
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:25,534
The generator is not really doing,

1119
00:58:25,534 --> 00:58:29,321
it's not really doing
classifications necessarily.

1120
00:58:29,321 --> 00:58:32,744
What it's objective is
is here, D of G of Z,

1121
00:58:32,744 --> 00:58:35,536
it wants this to be high.

1122
00:58:35,536 --> 00:58:40,228
So given a fixed discriminator,
it wants to learn the

1123
00:58:40,228 --> 00:58:42,487
generator parameter
such that this is high.

1124
00:58:42,487 --> 00:58:46,169
So we'll take the fixed
discriminator output and use that

1125
00:58:46,169 --> 00:58:47,752
to do the backprop.

1126
00:58:51,447 --> 00:58:54,219
Okay so in order to train
this, what we're going to do

1127
00:58:54,219 --> 00:58:57,714
is we're going to alternate
between gradient ascent

1128
00:58:57,714 --> 00:59:02,401
on our discriminator, so we're
trying to learn theta beta

1129
00:59:02,401 --> 00:59:05,222
to maximizing this objective.

1130
00:59:05,222 --> 00:59:08,059
And then gradient
descent on the generator.

1131
00:59:08,059 --> 00:59:12,247
So taking gradient ascent
on these parameters theta G

1132
00:59:12,247 --> 00:59:15,698
such that we're minimizing
this and this objective.

1133
00:59:15,698 --> 00:59:18,413
And here we are only taking
this right part over here

1134
00:59:18,413 --> 00:59:22,165
because that's the only
part that's dependent on

1135
00:59:22,165 --> 00:59:23,748
theta G parameters.

1136
00:59:26,574 --> 00:59:30,603
Okay so this is how we can train this GAN.

1137
00:59:30,603 --> 00:59:32,527
We can alternate between
training our discriminator

1138
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:35,716
and our generator in this
game, each trying to fool

1139
00:59:35,716 --> 00:59:40,561
the other or generator trying
to fool the discriminator.

1140
00:59:40,561 --> 00:59:44,027
But one thing that is important
to note is that in practice

1141
00:59:44,027 --> 00:59:48,802
this generator objective as
we've just defined actually

1142
00:59:48,802 --> 00:59:50,478
doesn't work that well.

1143
00:59:50,478 --> 00:59:54,169
And the reason for this is
we have to look at the loss

1144
00:59:54,169 --> 00:59:55,309
landscape.

1145
00:59:55,309 --> 01:00:00,059
So if we look at the loss
landscape over here for

1146
01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:01,059
D of G of X,

1147
01:00:02,858 --> 01:00:06,279
if we apply here one minus D of G of X

1148
01:00:06,279 --> 01:00:08,737
which is what we want to
minimize for the generator,

1149
01:00:08,737 --> 01:00:10,654
it has this shape here.

1150
01:00:12,748 --> 01:00:16,406
So we want to minimize this
and it turns out the slope

1151
01:00:16,406 --> 01:00:21,119
of this loss is actually going
to be higher towards the right.

1152
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,369
High when D of G of Z is closer to one.

1153
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:31,082
So that means that when our
generator is doing a good job

1154
01:00:31,082 --> 01:00:33,409
of fooling the discriminator,
we're going to have

1155
01:00:33,409 --> 01:00:36,837
a high gradient, more
higher gradient terms.

1156
01:00:36,837 --> 01:00:39,636
And on the other hand
when we have bad samples,

1157
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:43,068
our generator has not
learned a good job yet,

1158
01:00:43,068 --> 01:00:44,794
it's not good at generating yet,

1159
01:00:44,794 --> 01:00:47,992
then this is when the
discriminator can easily tell

1160
01:00:47,992 --> 01:00:52,159
it's now closer to this
zero region on the X axis.

1161
01:00:53,002 --> 01:00:55,482
Then here the gradient's relatively flat.

1162
01:00:55,482 --> 01:00:59,065
And so what this actually
means is that our

1163
01:01:00,288 --> 01:01:03,185
our gradient signal is
dominated by region where the

1164
01:01:03,185 --> 01:01:05,200
sample is already pretty good.

1165
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,011
Whereas we actually want it to
learn a lot when the samples

1166
01:01:08,011 --> 01:01:08,927
are bad, right?

1167
01:01:08,927 --> 01:01:12,624
These are training samples
that we want to learn from.

1168
01:01:12,624 --> 01:01:17,570
And so in order to, so this
basically makes it hard

1169
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:21,664
to learn and so in order
to improve learning,

1170
01:01:21,664 --> 01:01:23,767
what we're going to do
is define a different,

1171
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:26,320
slightly different objective
function for the gradient.

1172
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:30,145
Where now we're going to
do gradient ascent instead.

1173
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:32,229
And so instead of minimizing
the likelihood of our

1174
01:01:32,229 --> 01:01:35,748
discriminator being correct,
which is what we had earlier,

1175
01:01:35,748 --> 01:01:38,147
now we'll kind of flip
it and say let's maximize

1176
01:01:38,147 --> 01:01:40,908
the likelihood of our
discriminator being wrong.

1177
01:01:40,908 --> 01:01:45,075
And so this will produce this
objective here of maximizing,

1178
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,720
maximizing log of D of G of X.

1179
01:01:50,767 --> 01:01:52,517
And so, now basically

1180
01:01:56,575 --> 01:01:58,327
we want to, there should be a negative

1181
01:01:58,327 --> 01:01:59,160
sign here.

1182
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:03,327
But basically we want to now
maximize this flip objective

1183
01:02:04,492 --> 01:02:08,659
instead and what this now does
is if we plot this function

1184
01:02:10,118 --> 01:02:13,263
on the right here, then we
have a high gradient signal

1185
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:16,149
in this region on the left
where we have bad samples,

1186
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:20,316
and now the flatter region
is to the right where we

1187
01:02:21,566 --> 01:02:23,242
would have good samples.

1188
01:02:23,242 --> 01:02:25,582
So now we're going to
learn more from regions

1189
01:02:25,582 --> 01:02:26,571
of bad samples.

1190
01:02:26,571 --> 01:02:29,059
And so this has the same
objective of fooling

1191
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:31,995
the discriminator but it
actually works much better

1192
01:02:31,995 --> 01:02:35,990
in practice and for a lot
of work on GANs that are

1193
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:38,742
using these kind of
vanilla GAN formulation

1194
01:02:38,742 --> 01:02:41,492
is actually using this objective.

1195
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:48,387
Okay so just an aside on
that is that jointly training

1196
01:02:49,444 --> 01:02:53,964
these two networks is
challenging and can be unstable.

1197
01:02:53,964 --> 01:02:56,222
So as we saw here, like
we're alternating between

1198
01:02:56,222 --> 01:02:59,079
training a discriminator
and training a generator.

1199
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:03,246
This type of alternation is,
basically it's hard to learn

1200
01:03:04,418 --> 01:03:08,398
two networks at once and
there's also this issue

1201
01:03:08,398 --> 01:03:11,131
of depending on what our
loss landscape looks at,

1202
01:03:11,131 --> 01:03:13,815
it can affect our training dynamics.

1203
01:03:13,815 --> 01:03:17,735
So an active area of research
still is how can we choose

1204
01:03:17,735 --> 01:03:20,592
objectives with better loss
landscapes that can help

1205
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:23,342
training and make it more stable?

1206
01:03:26,516 --> 01:03:29,257
Okay so now let's put this
all together and look at the

1207
01:03:29,257 --> 01:03:31,152
full GAN training algorithm.

1208
01:03:31,152 --> 01:03:34,366
So what we're going to do is
for each iteration of training

1209
01:03:34,366 --> 01:03:37,674
we're going to first train the generation,

1210
01:03:37,674 --> 01:03:39,145
train the discriminator network a bit

1211
01:03:39,145 --> 01:03:41,078
and then train the generator network.

1212
01:03:41,078 --> 01:03:43,959
So for k steps of training
the discriminator network

1213
01:03:43,959 --> 01:03:47,861
we'll sample a mini batch
of noise samples from our

1214
01:03:47,861 --> 01:03:52,442
noise prior Z and then
also sample a mini batch

1215
01:03:52,442 --> 01:03:55,859
of real samples from our training data X.

1216
01:03:57,366 --> 01:04:01,410
So what we'll do is we'll
pass the noise through our

1217
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:04,519
generator, we'll get our fake images out.

1218
01:04:04,519 --> 01:04:07,019
So we have a mini batch of
fake images and mini batch

1219
01:04:07,019 --> 01:04:08,052
of real images.

1220
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:11,554
And then we'll pick a gradient
step on the discriminator

1221
01:04:11,554 --> 01:04:15,041
using this mini batch, our
fake and our real images

1222
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:17,891
and then update our
discriminator parameters.

1223
01:04:17,891 --> 01:04:21,318
And use this and do this a
certain number of iterations

1224
01:04:21,318 --> 01:04:24,313
to train the discriminator
for a bit basically.

1225
01:04:24,313 --> 01:04:26,452
And then after that we'll
go to our second step

1226
01:04:26,452 --> 01:04:28,803
which is training the generator.

1227
01:04:28,803 --> 01:04:32,544
And so here we'll sample just
a mini batch of noise samples.

1228
01:04:32,544 --> 01:04:36,205
We'll pass this through our
generator and then now we

1229
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:40,288
want to do backpop on this
to basically optimize our

1230
01:04:42,264 --> 01:04:45,078
generator objective that we saw earlier.

1231
01:04:45,078 --> 01:04:48,038
So we want to have our
generator fool our discriminator

1232
01:04:48,038 --> 01:04:49,705
as much as possible.

1233
01:04:50,773 --> 01:04:54,940
And so we're going to alternate
between these two steps

1234
01:04:56,041 --> 01:04:58,410
of taking gradient steps
for our discriminator

1235
01:04:58,410 --> 01:04:59,996
and for the generator.

1236
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:02,579
And I said for k steps up here,

1237
01:05:03,474 --> 01:05:06,306
for training the discriminator
and so this is kind

1238
01:05:06,306 --> 01:05:08,604
of a topic of debate.

1239
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:11,612
Some people think just having
one iteration of discriminator

1240
01:05:11,612 --> 01:05:15,391
one type of discriminator,
one type of generator is best.

1241
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:18,259
Some people think it's better
to train the discriminator

1242
01:05:18,259 --> 01:05:20,744
for a little bit longer before
switching to the generator.

1243
01:05:20,744 --> 01:05:24,771
There's no real clear rule
and it's something that

1244
01:05:24,771 --> 01:05:28,552
people have found different
things to work better

1245
01:05:28,552 --> 01:05:30,732
depending on the problem.

1246
01:05:30,732 --> 01:05:33,693
And one thing I want to point
out is that there's been

1247
01:05:33,693 --> 01:05:37,838
a lot of recent work that
alleviates this problem

1248
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:41,580
and makes it so you don't
have to spend so much effort

1249
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:45,028
trying to balance how the
training of these two networks.

1250
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:47,880
It'll have more stable training
and give better results.

1251
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:51,822
And so Wasserstein GAN
is an example of a paper

1252
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:55,655
that was an important
work towards doing this.

1253
01:06:00,313 --> 01:06:04,417
Okay so looking at the whole
picture we've now trained,

1254
01:06:04,417 --> 01:06:06,548
we have our network setup,
we've trained both our

1255
01:06:06,548 --> 01:06:09,767
generator network and
our discriminator network

1256
01:06:09,767 --> 01:06:11,785
and now after training for generation,

1257
01:06:11,785 --> 01:06:15,009
we can just take our generator
network and use this to

1258
01:06:15,009 --> 01:06:16,899
generate new images.

1259
01:06:16,899 --> 01:06:19,687
So we just take noise Z and
pass this through and generate

1260
01:06:19,687 --> 01:06:21,520
fake images from here.

1261
01:06:23,636 --> 01:06:27,352
Okay and so now let's look
at some generated samples

1262
01:06:27,352 --> 01:06:28,351
from these GANs.

1263
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:31,093
So here's an example of trained on MNIST

1264
01:06:31,093 --> 01:06:33,099
and then on the right on Faces.

1265
01:06:33,099 --> 01:06:36,195
And for each of these you can also see,

1266
01:06:36,195 --> 01:06:39,765
just for visualization
the closest, on the right,

1267
01:06:39,765 --> 01:06:42,349
the nearest neighbor from the
training set to the column

1268
01:06:42,349 --> 01:06:43,849
right next to it.

1269
01:06:43,849 --> 01:06:45,426
And so you can see that
we're able to generate

1270
01:06:45,426 --> 01:06:47,810
very realistic samples and
it never directly memorizes

1271
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:49,227
the training set.

1272
01:06:51,264 --> 01:06:54,003
And here are some examples
from the original GAN paper

1273
01:06:54,003 --> 01:06:56,061
on CIFAR images.

1274
01:06:56,061 --> 01:06:59,960
And these are still fairly,
not such good quality yet,

1275
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:03,200
these were, the original
work is from 2014,

1276
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,374
so these are some older, simpler networks.

1277
01:07:07,374 --> 01:07:11,541
And these were using simple,
fully connected networks.

1278
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:14,518
And so since that time
there's been a lot of work

1279
01:07:14,518 --> 01:07:16,018
on improving GANs.

1280
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,905
One example of a work that
really took a big step

1281
01:07:20,905 --> 01:07:24,645
towards improving the quality
of samples is this work

1282
01:07:24,645 --> 01:07:29,555
from Alex Radford in ICLR
2016 on adding convolutional

1283
01:07:29,555 --> 01:07:31,388
architectures to GANs.

1284
01:07:33,806 --> 01:07:37,663
In this paper there was
a whole set of guidelines

1285
01:07:37,663 --> 01:07:41,926
on architectures for helping
GANs to produce better

1286
01:07:41,926 --> 01:07:42,958
samples.

1287
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:46,517
So you can look at this for more details.

1288
01:07:46,517 --> 01:07:49,217
This is an example of a
convolutional architecture

1289
01:07:49,217 --> 01:07:52,669
that they're using which
is going from our input Z

1290
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:55,944
noise vector Z and
transforming this all the way

1291
01:07:55,944 --> 01:07:57,694
to the output sample.

1292
01:08:00,527 --> 01:08:03,437
So now from this large
convolutional architecture

1293
01:08:03,437 --> 01:08:06,446
we'll see that the samples
from this model are really

1294
01:08:06,446 --> 01:08:08,251
starting to look very good.

1295
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:11,408
So this is trained on
a dataset of bedrooms

1296
01:08:11,408 --> 01:08:15,575
and we can see all kinds of
very realistic fancy looking

1297
01:08:16,783 --> 01:08:20,950
bedrooms with windows and night
stands and other furniture

1298
01:08:22,926 --> 01:08:26,063
around there so these are
some really pretty samples.

1299
01:08:26,064 --> 01:08:29,828
And we can also try and
interpret a little bit of what

1300
01:08:29,828 --> 01:08:32,346
these GANs are doing.

1301
01:08:32,346 --> 01:08:36,151
So in this example here what
we can do is we can take

1302
01:08:36,152 --> 01:08:40,038
two points of Z, two
different random noise vectors

1303
01:08:40,038 --> 01:08:42,817
and let's just interpolate
between these points.

1304
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:45,245
And each row across here
is an interpolation from

1305
01:08:45,245 --> 01:08:50,142
one random noise Z to
another random noise vector Z

1306
01:08:50,142 --> 01:08:53,207
and you can see that as it's changing,

1307
01:08:53,207 --> 01:08:55,655
it's smoothly interpolating
the image as well

1308
01:08:55,656 --> 01:08:57,073
all the way over.

1309
01:08:59,286 --> 01:09:02,067
And so something else that
we can do is we can see that,

1310
01:09:02,067 --> 01:09:06,584
well, let's try to analyze
further what these vectors Z

1311
01:09:06,584 --> 01:09:10,313
mean, and so we can try
and do vector math on here.

1312
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:13,563
So what this experiment does is it says

1313
01:09:14,888 --> 01:09:17,828
okay, let's take some images of smiling,

1314
01:09:17,828 --> 01:09:22,099
samples of smiling women
images and then let's take some

1315
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:25,379
samples of neutral women
and then also some samples

1316
01:09:25,379 --> 01:09:26,629
of neutral men.

1317
01:09:28,341 --> 01:09:32,049
And so let's try and do take
the average of the Z vectors

1318
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:34,920
that produced each of
these samples and if we,

1319
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:38,184
Say we take this, mean
vector for the smiling women,

1320
01:09:38,184 --> 01:09:40,783
subtract the mean vector
for the neutral women

1321
01:09:40,783 --> 01:09:43,786
and add the mean vector
for the neutral man,

1322
01:09:43,787 --> 01:09:45,037
what do we get?

1323
01:09:46,651 --> 01:09:49,884
And we get samples of smiling man.

1324
01:09:49,884 --> 01:09:52,200
So we can take the Z
vector produced there,

1325
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:56,200
generate samples and get
samples of smiling men.

1326
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:59,712
And we can have another example of this.

1327
01:09:59,712 --> 01:10:03,879
Of glasses man minus no glasses
man and plus glasses women.

1328
01:10:05,918 --> 01:10:08,763
And get women with glasses.

1329
01:10:08,763 --> 01:10:12,483
So here you can see that
basically the Z has this type

1330
01:10:12,483 --> 01:10:16,191
of interpretability that
you can use this to generate

1331
01:10:16,191 --> 01:10:18,358
some pretty cool examples.

1332
01:10:20,026 --> 01:10:22,300
Okay so this year, 2017 has really been

1333
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:23,967
the year of the GAN.

1334
01:10:24,842 --> 01:10:28,309
There's been tons and tons of work on GANs

1335
01:10:28,309 --> 01:10:31,737
and it's really sort of
exploded and gotten some really

1336
01:10:31,737 --> 01:10:33,261
cool results.

1337
01:10:33,261 --> 01:10:37,017
So on the left here you
can see people working on

1338
01:10:37,017 --> 01:10:38,680
better training and generation.

1339
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,454
So we talked about improving
the loss functions,

1340
01:10:41,454 --> 01:10:45,621
more stable training and this
was able to get really nice

1341
01:10:47,216 --> 01:10:50,173
generations here of different
types of architectures

1342
01:10:50,173 --> 01:10:54,326
on the bottom here really
crisp high resolution faces.

1343
01:10:54,326 --> 01:10:58,918
With GANs you can also do,
there's also been models on

1344
01:10:58,918 --> 01:11:01,742
source to try to domain
transfer and conditional GANs.

1345
01:11:01,742 --> 01:11:04,394
And so here, this is an
example of source to try to

1346
01:11:04,394 --> 01:11:08,363
get domain transfer where,
for example in the upper part

1347
01:11:08,363 --> 01:11:12,540
here we are trying to go
from source domain of horses

1348
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,703
to an output domain of zebras.

1349
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:18,692
So we can take an image
of horses and train a GAN

1350
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:21,646
such that the output is
going to be the same thing

1351
01:11:21,646 --> 01:11:25,813
but now zebras in the same
image setting as the horses

1352
01:11:28,408 --> 01:11:29,915
and go the other way around.

1353
01:11:29,915 --> 01:11:33,124
We can transform apples into oranges.

1354
01:11:33,124 --> 01:11:35,128
And also the other way around.

1355
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:38,608
We can also use this to
do photo enhancement.

1356
01:11:38,608 --> 01:11:41,676
So producing these, really
taking a standard photo

1357
01:11:41,676 --> 01:11:46,218
and trying to make really
nice, as if you had,

1358
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:48,717
pretending that you have a
really nice expensive camera.

1359
01:11:48,717 --> 01:11:52,379
That you can get the nice blur effects.

1360
01:11:52,379 --> 01:11:55,987
On the bottom here we have scene changing,

1361
01:11:55,987 --> 01:11:59,733
so transforming an image
of Yosemite from the image

1362
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:03,750
in winter time to the
image in summer time.

1363
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:05,753
And there's really tons of applications.

1364
01:12:05,753 --> 01:12:08,430
So on the right here there's more.

1365
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:11,930
There's also going from a text description

1366
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,839
and having a GAN that's now
conditioned on this text

1367
01:12:15,839 --> 01:12:18,343
description and producing an image.

1368
01:12:18,343 --> 01:12:21,572
So there's something
here about a small bird

1369
01:12:21,572 --> 01:12:25,094
with a pink breast and crown
and now we're going to generate

1370
01:12:25,094 --> 01:12:26,421
images of this.

1371
01:12:26,421 --> 01:12:30,588
And there's also examples
down here of filling in edges.

1372
01:12:31,808 --> 01:12:34,436
So given conditions on some sketch that we have,

1373
01:12:34,436 --> 01:12:38,603
can we fill in a color version
of what this would look like.

1374
01:12:40,848 --> 01:12:45,015
Can we take a Google, a
map grid and put something

1375
01:12:47,127 --> 01:12:49,033
that looks like Google Earth on,

1376
01:12:49,033 --> 01:12:52,528
and turn it into something
that looks like Google Earth.

1377
01:12:52,528 --> 01:12:55,492
Go in and hallucinate all
of these buildings and trees

1378
01:12:55,492 --> 01:12:56,767
and so on.

1379
01:12:56,767 --> 01:12:59,825
And so there's lots of
really cool examples of this.

1380
01:12:59,825 --> 01:13:03,575
And there's also this
website for pics to pics

1381
01:13:04,591 --> 01:13:06,869
which did a lot of these
kind of conditional GAN type

1382
01:13:06,869 --> 01:13:08,077
examples.

1383
01:13:08,077 --> 01:13:12,244
I encourage you to go look
at for more interesting

1384
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:17,549
applications that people
have done with GANs.

1385
01:13:17,549 --> 01:13:20,473
And in terms of research
papers there's also

1386
01:13:20,473 --> 01:13:24,640
there's a huge number of papers
about GANs this year now.

1387
01:13:26,047 --> 01:13:29,528
There's a website called
the GAN Zoo that kind of is

1388
01:13:29,528 --> 01:13:31,365
trying to compile a whole list of these.

1389
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:35,036
And so here this has only
taken me from A through C

1390
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:37,690
on the left here and
through like L on the right.

1391
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:40,076
So it won't even fit on the slide.

1392
01:13:40,076 --> 01:13:42,446
There's tons of papers as
well that you can look at

1393
01:13:42,446 --> 01:13:44,794
if you're interested.

1394
01:13:44,794 --> 01:13:48,961
And then one last pointer
is also for tips and tricks

1395
01:13:49,927 --> 01:13:53,348
for training GANs, here's
a nice little website

1396
01:13:53,348 --> 01:13:57,259
that has pointers if you're
trying to train these GANs

1397
01:13:57,259 --> 01:13:58,342
in practice.

1398
01:14:01,313 --> 01:14:03,396
Okay, so summary of GANs.

1399
01:14:04,336 --> 01:14:06,915
GANs don't work with an
explicit density function.

1400
01:14:06,915 --> 01:14:10,036
Instead we're going to represent
this implicitly through

1401
01:14:10,036 --> 01:14:13,989
samples and they take a
game-theoretic approach to training

1402
01:14:13,989 --> 01:14:16,092
so we're going to learn to
generate from our training

1403
01:14:16,092 --> 01:14:18,973
distribution through a
two player game setup.

1404
01:14:18,973 --> 01:14:21,947
And the pros of GANs are
that they're really having

1405
01:14:21,947 --> 01:14:24,934
gorgeous state of the art
samples and you can do a lot

1406
01:14:24,934 --> 01:14:26,212
with these.

1407
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:29,580
The cons are that they are
trickier and more unstable

1408
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:33,247
to train, we're not
just directly optimizing

1409
01:14:36,499 --> 01:14:40,054
a one objective function
that we can just do backpop

1410
01:14:40,054 --> 01:14:41,830
and train easily.

1411
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:44,648
Instead we have these two
networks that we're trying

1412
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:47,710
to balance training with so
it can be a bit more unstable.

1413
01:14:47,710 --> 01:14:50,979
And we also can lose out
on not being able to do

1414
01:14:50,979 --> 01:14:54,915
some of the inference queries,
P of X, P of Z given X

1415
01:14:54,915 --> 01:14:57,629
that we had for example in our VAE.

1416
01:14:57,629 --> 01:15:00,051
And GANs are still an
active area of research,

1417
01:15:00,051 --> 01:15:04,427
this is a relatively new type
of model that we're starting

1418
01:15:04,427 --> 01:15:07,040
to see a lot of and you'll
be seeing a lot more of.

1419
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:11,556
And so people are still working
now on better loss functions

1420
01:15:11,556 --> 01:15:14,994
more stable training, so Wasserstein GAN

1421
01:15:14,994 --> 01:15:18,994
for those of you who are
interested is basically

1422
01:15:20,585 --> 01:15:22,224
an improvement in this direction.

1423
01:15:22,224 --> 01:15:25,099
That now a lot of people are
also using and basing models

1424
01:15:25,099 --> 01:15:26,387
off of.

1425
01:15:26,387 --> 01:15:29,759
There's also other works
like LSGAN, Least Square's GAN,

1426
01:15:29,759 --> 01:15:31,489
Least Square's GAN and others.

1427
01:15:31,489 --> 01:15:32,871
So you can look into this more.

1428
01:15:32,871 --> 01:15:35,285
And a lot of times for these new models

1429
01:15:35,285 --> 01:15:37,108
in terms of actually implementing this,

1430
01:15:37,108 --> 01:15:39,307
they're not necessarily big changes.

1431
01:15:39,307 --> 01:15:41,622
They're different loss
functions that you can change

1432
01:15:41,622 --> 01:15:43,407
a little bit and get
like a big improvement

1433
01:15:43,407 --> 01:15:44,279
in training.

1434
01:15:44,279 --> 01:15:47,159
And so this is, some of
these are worth looking into

1435
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:50,115
and you'll also get some
practice on your homework

1436
01:15:50,115 --> 01:15:51,500
assignment.

1437
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:54,410
And there's also a lot of
work on different types of

1438
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:57,279
conditional GANs and GANs
for all kinds of different

1439
01:15:57,279 --> 01:15:59,946
problem setups and applications.

1440
01:16:01,648 --> 01:16:03,507
Okay so a recap of today.

1441
01:16:03,507 --> 01:16:05,807
We talked about generative models.

1442
01:16:05,807 --> 01:16:08,538
We talked about three of the
most common kinds of generative

1443
01:16:08,538 --> 01:16:12,329
models that people are using
and doing research on today.

1444
01:16:12,329 --> 01:16:15,098
So we talked first about
pixelRNN and pixelCNN,

1445
01:16:15,098 --> 01:16:17,588
which is an explicit density model.

1446
01:16:17,588 --> 01:16:20,710
It optimizes the exact
likelihood and it produces good

1447
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:24,607
samples but it's pretty
inefficient because of the

1448
01:16:24,607 --> 01:16:26,981
sequential generation.

1449
01:16:26,981 --> 01:16:29,902
We looked at VAE which
optimizes a variational or lower

1450
01:16:29,902 --> 01:16:32,696
bound on the likelihood
and this also produces

1451
01:16:32,696 --> 01:16:35,090
useful a latent representation.

1452
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,890
You can do inference queries.

1453
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:40,305
But the example quality
is still not the best.

1454
01:16:40,305 --> 01:16:42,715
So even though it has a
lot of promise, it's still

1455
01:16:42,715 --> 01:16:46,583
a very active area of
research and has a lot of

1456
01:16:46,583 --> 01:16:47,657
open problems.

1457
01:16:47,657 --> 01:16:51,654
And then GANs we talked
about is a game-theoretic

1458
01:16:51,654 --> 01:16:55,089
approach for training and
it's what currently achieves

1459
01:16:55,089 --> 01:16:57,375
the best state of the art examples.

1460
01:16:57,375 --> 01:17:00,253
But it can also be tricky
and unstable to train

1461
01:17:00,253 --> 01:17:05,047
and it loses out a bit
on the inference queries.

1462
01:17:05,047 --> 01:17:08,108
And so what you'll also
see is a lot of recent work

1463
01:17:08,108 --> 01:17:10,239
on combinations of these kinds of models.

1464
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:12,733
So for example adversarial autoencoders.

1465
01:17:12,733 --> 01:17:14,865
Something like a VAE
trained with an additional

1466
01:17:14,865 --> 01:17:18,478
adversarial loss on top which
improves the sample quality.

1467
01:17:18,478 --> 01:17:21,517
There's also things like
pixelVAE is now a combination

1468
01:17:21,517 --> 01:17:23,848
of pixelCNN and VAE so
there's a lot of combinations

1469
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:28,015
basically trying to take
the best of all these worlds

1470
01:17:29,808 --> 01:17:32,444
and put them together.

1471
01:17:32,444 --> 01:17:35,000
Okay so today we talked
about generative models

1472
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,449
and next time we'll talk
about reinforcement learning.

1473
01:17:38,449 --> 01:17:42,449
Thanks.
